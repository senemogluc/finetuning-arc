You are given a series of inputs and output pairs. 
These are all in the form of a 2D array, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. 
The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. You can think of them as different colors. You can consider 0 as the background.

Use the following priors to infer the transformation rule:

> Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object
> Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. In many cases objects from the input persiston the output grid, often in a transformed form.
> Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. This may include translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
> Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.

- View each task as a problem that may involve one or more of the mentioned priors.
- Pay attention to object relationships, transformations, and persistence.
- Implicitly identify goals or intentions guiding the transformations.
- Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
- Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined.
- Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one.
- Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input output pairs.
- Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.


Please generate the Output grid that corresponds to the last given Input grid using the transformation rule you induced from the previous input-output pairs.
