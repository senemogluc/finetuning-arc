Explanation:
For each case, we can see that the middle element in each row is common. This means that the sum of the elements in each row is the same. 
For Case 0, the sum of elements in each row is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15. 
For Case 1, the sum of elements in each row is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 
For Case 2, the sum of elements in each row is 8 + 8 + 8 = 24. 
For Case 3, the sum of elements in each row is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. 
For Case 4, the sum of elements in each row is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. 
For Case 5, the sum of elements in each row is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15. 
For Case 6, the sum of elements in each row is 6 + 6 + 6 = 18. 

To find the output, we subtract the minimum value from each row sum. The minimum value is 15, so we subtract 15 from each row sum: 15 - 15 = 0, 3 - 15 = -12, 24 - 15 = 9, 12 - 15 = -3, 15 - 15 = 0, 18 - 15 = 3. 

The output is then the result of subtracting the minimum value from each row sum: [0, -12, 9, -3, 0, 3]. 

To find the correct output, we can see that the middle value is common to each row, so we can find the output by subtracting the minimum value from the middle value: 15 - 15 = 0. 

The correct output for each case is then [0].
