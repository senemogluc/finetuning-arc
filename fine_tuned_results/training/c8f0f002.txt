Explanation:
In each case, the input matrix is transformed into an output matrix by replacing each digit with its corresponding value from the set {1, 5, 7}. This transformation is done in such a way that the structure of the matrix is preserved, and each value in the input matrix is mapped to a unique value in the output matrix.

For example, in the first case, the digit 1 in the input matrix is mapped to 1 in the output matrix, the digit 7 in the input matrix is mapped to 5 in the output matrix, and the digit 8 in the input matrix is mapped to 8 in the output matrix. This transformation ensures that the structure of the matrix is preserved, and each value in the input matrix is mapped to a unique value in the output matrix.

Similarly, in the second case, the digit 1 in the input matrix is mapped to 1 in the output matrix, the digit 7 in the input matrix is mapped to 5 in the output matrix, and the digit 8 in the input matrix is mapped to 8 in the output matrix. This transformation ensures that the structure of the matrix is preserved, and each value in the input matrix is mapped to a unique value in the output matrix.

In the third case, the digit 1 in the input matrix is mapped to 1 in the output matrix, the digit 7 in the input matrix is mapped to 5 in the output matrix, and the digit 8 in the input matrix is mapped to 8 in the output matrix. This transformation ensures that the structure of the matrix is preserved, and each value in the input matrix is mapped to a unique value in the output matrix.

Overall, the transformation from the input matrix to the output matrix is done in such a way that the structure of the matrix is preserved, and each value in the input matrix is mapped to a unique value in the output matrix, resulting in the correct output for each case.
