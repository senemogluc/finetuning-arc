Explanation:
In each case, we are given a 3x3 matrix with values representing the state of a system. The values can be thought of as representing the state of a binary system (on/off, 1/0, true/false, etc.). We are asked to find the number of cases where the system is in a "stable" state, which we define as a state where the system's state values are the same in all three rows. 

For example, in Case 0, the system's state values are the same in all three rows, which corresponds to the binary state of 1 (true). Therefore, the output for Case 0 is [[1]]. 

Similarly, in Case 1, the system's state values are the same in the first and third rows, but different in the second row, which corresponds to the binary state of 7 (false). Therefore, the output for Case 1 is [[7]]. 

We can apply this reasoning to the other cases as well, resulting in the outputs [[1]], [[7]], and [[1]] for Cases 2, 3, and 5, respectively.

To find the general rule, we can look at the pattern of outputs: [[1]], [[7]], and [[1]]. This pattern corresponds to the binary states of 1 (true), 7 (false), and 1 (true), respectively. 

Therefore, the general rule for this problem is to count the number of cases where the system's state values are the same in all three rows (1), different in the first and third rows (7), or different in the second row (1).

Case 0: 1 (all rows the same)
Case 1: 7 (first and third rows the same, second row different)
Case 2: 1 (second row the same, first and third rows different)

So, the general rule is: Count the number of cases where the system's state values are the same in all three rows (1), different in the first and third rows (7), or different in the second row (1).
