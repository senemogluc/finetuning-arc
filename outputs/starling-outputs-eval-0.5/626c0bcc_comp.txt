Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid:
   - Object A: [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0] (top-left)
   - Object B: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] (middle)
   - Object C: [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0] (bottom-left)
   - Object D: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0] (bottom-right)

2. Analyze relationships and transformations between objects:
   - Objects A and B are touching horizontally, so they can be combined to form a single object with a width of 6.
   - Objects C and D are also touching horizontally, so they can be combined to form another single object with a width of 5.

3. Apply counting or sorting tasks:
   - Count the number of objects in the grid (4).

4. Transform the input grid based on relationships, transformations, and goals:
   - Combine Objects A and B to form Object E: [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]
   - Combine Objects C and D to form Object F: [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]

5. Output grid:
   - [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0] (Object E)
   - [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] (Object E)
   - [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0] (Object F)
   - [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0] (Object F)

Output grid:
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
