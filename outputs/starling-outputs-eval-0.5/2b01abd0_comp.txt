Based on the given transformation rules and the previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves identifying and preserving objects with the same number adjacent to each other and maintaining their positions as much as possible. 

Here's the reasoning for the last input:

1. Identify and separate objects based on their numbers. In this case, we have four types of objects: (0, 0), (2, 2), (3, 3), and (8, 8).
2. Preserve the position of each object type as much as possible. For example, the (2, 2) objects are in the same relative positions in both input and output.
3. Replace the remaining cells with the background color (0, 0).
4. The output grid should have the same dimensions as the input grid.

Applying these steps to the last input grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
