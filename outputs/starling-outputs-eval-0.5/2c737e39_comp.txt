Here's a possible transformation rule for the given inputs and outputs:

1. Identify and separate objects based on different values (colors).
2. For each object with at least one instance, find its centroid (average position) horizontally and vertically.

Now let's apply this rule to the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]

This output is not exactly the same as the given output. However, it's important to note that the transformation rule we induced from the previous input-output pairs may not be perfect for every case. It's possible that a different rule or a slight modification of this rule might lead to a closer match with the given output.
