Based on the given input and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a clear transformation rule. However, I can provide you with an output grid that might be considered valid based on some assumptions:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
