Based on the given prior rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The input grid has different patterns compared to the previous cases, and there isn't enough information to infer a consistent transformation rule. 

To provide an output for this input, we would need more context or additional priors to guide the transformation process.
