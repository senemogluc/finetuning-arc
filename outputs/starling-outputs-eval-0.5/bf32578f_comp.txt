Based on the given input and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies consistently across all cases. However, I can provide an output grid for the last input based on some assumptions:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is based on the assumption that objects with the same color are part of the same object and are not occluded by other objects. However, it's important to note that there might be multiple valid outputs depending on the specific transformation rule applied.
