Based on the transformation rules and priors you have mentioned, it's difficult to determine the exact output for the given input. However, I can provide a reasonable guess based on the patterns observed in previous cases. Here is one possible output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
