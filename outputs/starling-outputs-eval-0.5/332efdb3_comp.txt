I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here's the correct output for the last input grid (Case 3):

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

The transformation rule is as follows:

1. Identify objects by their adjacent same-colored neighbors.
2. Transform each object by applying the following rules:
   a. If an object has no more adjacent neighbors of its color, it becomes a new object with the background color (0).
   b. If an object has at least one adjacent neighbor of its color, it remains unchanged.
3. Remove any objects that are completely surrounded by other objects or have no connection to the output grid's boundary.
