Here's the reasoning for each step and then the final output grid:

1. Identify objects with same numbers adjacent to each other.
2. Treat these objects as a single entity, transforming their positions if necessary.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects by comparing their sizes, shapes, or colors.
4. Apply basic arithmetic and geometry concepts to the transformed grid.
5. Ensure that the final output grid is consistent with the input-output pairs seen so far.

After applying these rules, we get the following output grid:

  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8]
  [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
