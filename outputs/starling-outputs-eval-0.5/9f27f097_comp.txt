Based on the provided transformation rules and prior tasks, we can deduce the following steps to generate the output grid for the last input:

1. Identify the objects in the grid, which are formed by same-numbered adjacent elements. In this case, the objects are:
   - Object 1: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 0)
   - Object 2: [8, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 1)
   - Object 3: [8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 2)
   - Object 4: [8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 3)
   - Object 5: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 4)
   - Object 6: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 5)
   - Object 7: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 6)
   - Object 8: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 7)
   - Object 9: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 8)
   - Object 10: [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 9)
   - Object 11: [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 10)
   - Object 12: [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (row 11)

2. For each object, apply the transformation rule that the objects persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects, and recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can see that all objects have the same structure as Object 1, so no transformation is needed.

3. Combine the transformed objects to form the output grid:
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Output:
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
