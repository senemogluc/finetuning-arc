Here's the reasoning for each step in the transformation process:

1. Identify objects and relationships: In this case, we can identify four distinct objects with values {5, 5}, {4, 4}, {5, 2} and {5, 5}. The relationship between these objects is that they are touching each other along their edges.

2. Apply counting or sorting tasks: There's no specific counting or sorting task in this case. However, we can notice the distribution of values within the objects.

3. Recognize physical contact and transformations: The transformation rule involves moving the objects in a way that maintains their relationships with each other while minimizing the number of moves needed. In this case, we can observe that the {5, 2} object is surrounded by {5, 5} objects. By moving the {5, 5} objects one step to the left and downward, we can create a rectangular shape with the minimum number of moves.

4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for numerical aspects: There are no specific numerical aspects in this case.

5. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: In this case, we can observe that the objects form a rectangle when they are moved. The rectangle is formed by two horizontal and two vertical moves of the {5, 5} objects.

6. Check whether the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule seems to work fine for all the previous cases, as it maintains the relationships between objects while minimizing the number of moves needed.

Based on this reasoning, here's the output grid for the last input:

  [5, 5, 4, 4]
  [5, 5, 5, 2]
  [2, 5, 5, 5]
  [5, 5, 2, 4]
