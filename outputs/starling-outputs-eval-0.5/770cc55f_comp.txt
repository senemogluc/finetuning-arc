Based on the transformation rule induced from previous cases, we can infer that the objects with the same number should be grouped together and translated to a common center. Here's the step-by-step reasoning for each option:

1. Grouping objects with the same number: 
   - In the input grid, there are two groups of objects with the same numbers: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7] and [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]. 

2. Translating to a common center:
   - For the group [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], the center can be considered as (3+1)/2 = 2. So, we will translate this group by subtracting 2 from each element and adding it back at position (2, 0). 
   - For the group [0, 2, 2, 2, 2], the center can be considered as (1+1)/2 = 1. So, we will translate this group by subtracting 1 from each element and adding it back at position (1, 3).

3. Applying counting and basic arithmetic:
   - The group [7, 7, 7, 7, 7] becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] after translation.
   - The group [0, 2, 2, 2, 2] becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] after translation.

4. Combining the translated groups:
   - Combine the two translated groups to form the output grid:
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
     [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]

So, the output grid for the last input is:

  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]
