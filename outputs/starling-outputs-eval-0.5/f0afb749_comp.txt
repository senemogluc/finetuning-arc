Here's an explanation of the transformation rules applied to each case:

Case 0:
- The input grid consists of two interconnected objects (5s). The transformation rule is to connect all instances of the same number. So, we create a new grid where all connected 5s are replaced with 1 and the remaining cells are replaced with 0. Then, we duplicate the grid twice horizontally and once vertically, creating a larger grid with the same patterns.

Case 1:
- The input grid consists of two objects (2 and 0). Following the transformation rule, we connect all instances of the same number. So, we create a new grid where the 2s are connected and replaced with 1, and the remaining cells are replaced with 0. Then, we duplicate the grid horizontally twice, creating a larger grid with the same patterns.

Case 2:
- The input grid consists of three objects (0, 3, and 0). Following the transformation rule, we connect all instances of the same number. So, we create a new grid where the 3s are connected and replaced with 1, and the remaining cells are replaced with 0. Then, we duplicate the grid horizontally and vertically, creating a larger grid with the same patterns.

Case 3:
- The input grid consists of three objects (0, 4, and 0). Following the transformation rule, we connect all instances of the same number. So, we create a new grid where the 4s are connected and replaced with 1, and the remaining cells are replaced with 0. Then, we duplicate the grid horizontally twice, creating a larger grid with the same patterns.

For Case 3, the output grid is:

  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
