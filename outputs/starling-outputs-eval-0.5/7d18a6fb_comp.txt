Here's the reasoning for each case:

Case 1:
The transformation rule here can be described as follows:
- Merge all adjacent objects with the same value. In other words, combine horizontally and vertically adjacent objects that have the same color (value). 
- For example, in the input grid, there are two 4x2 rectangles of the same color (0), which merge into a single 8x2 rectangle in the output grid. Similarly, the 1's in the top row and bottom row of the input grid also merge horizontally to form rows with 4 consecutive 1's in the output grid.
- The merging process continues until no more adjacent objects with the same value can be merged. 

Using this transformation rule, we get the following output grid for Case 1:

  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  

Case 2:
The transformation rule here can be described as follows:
- Merge all adjacent objects with the same value. In other words, combine horizontally and vertically adjacent objects that have the same color (value). 
- For example, in the input grid, there are two 4x1 rectangles of the same color (0), which merge into a single 8x1 rectangle in the output grid. Similarly, the 5's and 3's in the top row and bottom row of the input grid also merge horizontally to form rows with 2 consecutive 5's and 3's in the output grid.
- The merging process continues until no more adjacent objects with the same value can be merged. 

Using this transformation rule, we get the following output grid for Case 2:

  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3]
  [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3]
  

Case 3:
The transformation rule here can be described as follows:
- Merge all adjacent objects with the same value. In other words, combine horizontally and vertically adjacent objects that have the same color (value). 
- For example, in the input grid, there are four 2x1 rectangles of the same color (0), which merge into a single 8x1 rectangle in the output grid. Similarly, the 6's and 3's in the middle row of the input grid also merge horizontally to form rows with 4 consecutive 6's and 3's in the output grid.

Using this transformation rule, we get the following output grid for Case 3:

  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  

In summary:

Case 1 Output:
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  
Case 2 Output:
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3]
  [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3]
  
Case 3 Output:
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4]
