Here's a possible interpretation for the given input and the transformation rules induced from previous cases:

1. Treat the 2D grid as an adjacency matrix representation of a graph. The values in the grid represent the weights or costs associated with the edges between the nodes (objects).
2. Perform a depth-first search traversal on the graph, starting from the top-left node (0, 0). Keep track of visited nodes and their corresponding costs.
3. For each visited node, check if it has an adjacent node with the same weight and is connected by a horizontal edge. If so, merge the two nodes into one, and update the cost of the merged node to be the sum of the two original node's costs. This represents the physical contact between the objects.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes have been visited or no more merges can be performed.
5. The output grid will contain the final merged nodes, with their corresponding costs.

Here's the output for the last input:

  [16, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0]

Explanation:

1. Start at node (0, 0) with cost 0. There are no adjacent nodes with the same weight and connected by a horizontal edge, so leave it as a single node.
2. Move to node (0, 1) with cost 8. It has an adjacent node with the same weight and is connected by a horizontal edge, so merge them into one node at (0, 1). The merged node's cost becomes the sum of both original nodes' costs: 0 + 8 = 8.
3. Move to node (0, 2) with cost 0. There are no adjacent nodes with the same weight and connected by a horizontal edge, so leave it as a single node.
4. All nodes have been visited and merged as necessary. The output grid is:

  [16, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0]
