Here are the steps to generate the Output grid for the last given Input grid:

1. Identify and apply the priors from previous cases:
   - Persistence of objects despite noise or occlusion
   - Transformation rules (e.g., translation, rebounding)
   - Recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects
   - Comparing numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects

2. Analyze the Input grid:
   The last given Input grid is:
  [0, 7, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 4, 0]
  [1, 0, 3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [...] (the grid continues with the same pattern)

3. Apply the priors to generate the Output grid:
   - Persistence of objects despite noise or occlusion: Objects that are adjacent and share the same number persist throughout the grid. For example, the object with value 5 is persistent across the entire grid.
   - Transformation rules (e.g., translation, rebounding): As the grid is symmetric along both horizontal and vertical axes, we can apply a reflection transformation to the Input grid to obtain the Output grid. This results in:

Output:
  [0, 7, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 4, 0]
  [1, 0, 3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [...] (the grid continues with the same pattern)

In this case, applying a reflection transformation is sufficient to generate the Output grid.
