Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships:
   - Object 1: [0, 2, 0, 2] (top-left)
   - Object 2: [2, 2, 0, 2] (middle)
   - Object 3: [2, 2, 0, 0] (bottom-middle)
   - Object 4: [0, 0, 0, 2] (bottom-left)

2. Determine transformations and persistence:
   - Object 1 and 2 are adjacent and have the same color pattern, so they can be combined.
   - Object 3 is also adjacent to Object 4 and has a similar pattern with one difference in the bottom row. They can be combined as well.
   - The combined objects will persist through the transformation process.

3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic:
   - Counting the number of occurrences of each color:
     - 0: 4 times (2x in Object 1, 2x in Object 4)
     - 2: 6 times (3x in Object 1, 3x in Object 3)

4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts:
   - The combined objects form a rectangle shape with two rows of the same color pattern.

5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one:
   - Option 1: Combine Object 1 and 2, then combine the result with Object 3 and 4.
     - This option maintains the rectangular shape and preserves the color patterns of the original objects.
     - The final grid will have 8 rows and 4 columns.

6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs:
   - Since this is the last input-output pair, we cannot verify it against previous cases. However, based on the reasoning and principles applied so far, it's reasonable to assume that the transformation will work for this case as well.

Final Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
