Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. The first step is to identify objects and their relationships in the input grid. In this case, we can see that all objects have a size of 2x2 or 3x3. There are no intersecting objects, so we don't need to worry about object persistence at this stage.
2. Next, we look for adjacent objects with the same numbers. We can see that 8s and 0s are adjacent to each other in several places, forming 3x3 objects. This suggests that these objects belong to the same group.
3. Based on the adjacency of 8s and 0s, we can infer that they represent the same object. Since there are no intersecting objects, we can safely merge them into a single object.
4. After merging the 8s and 0s, we get the following output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid represents a single object formed by merging the adjacent 8s and 0s. The merged object has a size of 3x3, and the numbers are doubled to indicate that they belong to the same group.
