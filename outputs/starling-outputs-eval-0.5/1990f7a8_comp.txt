Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify same-numbered adjacent objects:
   - In the first row, we have a single object with 2 occurrences of 0.
   - In the second and third rows, we can see two separate objects with 2 occurrences each.
   - In the fourth row, there are two separate objects with 2 occurrences each.
   - In the fifth row, we have a single object with 3 occurrences of 0, and another object with 2 occurrences of 0.
   - In the sixth row, there are two separate objects with 3 occurrences each.
   - In the seventh row, we can see three separate objects with 1 occurrence each.

2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects:
   - Count the number of objects in each row and find the average number of objects per row (if applicable).
   - Sort the objects by their values if necessary.

3. Apply basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects:
   - In the first row, there's only one object with 2 occurrences of 0. The average number of objects is 1.
   - In the second and third rows, both have two separate objects with 2 occurrences each. The total number of objects is 4, and the average number of objects is 2.
   - In the fourth row, there are two separate objects with 2 occurrences each. The total number of objects is 4, and the average number of objects is 2.
   - In the fifth row, there's one object with 3 occurrences of 0, and another object with 2 occurrences of 0. The total number of objects is 5, and the average number of objects is 2.5.
   - In the sixth row, both have three separate objects with 3 occurrences each. The total number of objects is 9, and the average number of objects is 3.
   - In the seventh row, there are three separate objects with 1 occurrence each. The total number of objects is 3, and the average number of objects is 1.

4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts:
   - Identify the boundaries of each object by looking at their positions in the grid.
   - Determine if there are any overlapping or intersecting objects. If so, merge them into a single object.

5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one:
   - In the first row, we have only one object with 2 occurrences of 0. Since it's a single object, we don't need to change anything.
   - In the second and third rows, both have two separate objects with 2 occurrences each. The total number of objects is 4, and the average number of objects is 2. We can merge these objects into one larger object that spans both rows.
   - In the fourth row, there are two separate objects with 2 occurrences each. The total number of objects is 4, and the average number of objects is 2. Similar to the previous case, we can merge these objects into one larger object that spans both rows.
   - In the fifth row, there's one object with 3 occurrences of 0, and another object with 2 occurrences of 0. The total number of objects is 5, and the average number of objects is 2.5. We can merge these objects into one larger object that spans both rows. However, since the two objects are not adjacent horizontally or vertically, we cannot merge them.
   - In the sixth row, both have three separate objects with 3 occurrences each. The total number of objects is 9, and the average number of objects is 3. We can merge these objects into one larger object that spans both rows.
   - In the seventh row, there are three separate objects with 1 occurrence each. The total number of objects is 3, and the average number of objects is 1. Since all of them are adjacent horizontally or vertically, we can merge these objects into one larger object that spans both rows.

6. Based on the reasoning above, the output grid should be:

  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

The output grid for the last input is:

  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
