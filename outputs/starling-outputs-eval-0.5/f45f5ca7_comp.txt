Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
1. Identify objects and their persistence in the grid.
2. Recognize that there are two main objects: one with values 3, 8, and 2, and another with values 4 and 2. These objects persist throughout the grid.
3. Apply transformation rules to obtain the output grid by moving the objects based on their neighboring values. For example, the first object moves left (from position [3, 0] to [0, 0]) because it is adjacent to a value of 4. The second object moves down (from position [2, 0] to [0, 2]) because it is adjacent to a value of 8.

Case 1:
1. Identify objects and their persistence in the grid.
2. Recognize that there are two main objects: one with values 3, 2, and 4, and another with values 8, 0, and 3. These objects persist throughout the grid.
3. Apply transformation rules to obtain the output grid by moving the objects based on their neighboring values. For example, the first object moves left (from position [3, 0] to [0, 0]) because it is adjacent to a value of 8. The second object moves down (from position [2, 0] to [0, 2]) because it is adjacent to a value of 8.

Case 2:
1. Identify objects and their persistence in the grid.
2. Recognize that there are two main objects: one with values 8, 3, and 2, and another with values 4, 3, and 8. These objects persist throughout the grid.
3. Apply transformation rules to obtain the output grid by moving the objects based on their neighboring values. For example, the first object moves left (from position [8, 0] to [0, 0]) because it is adjacent to a value of 4. The second object moves down (from position [3, 0] to [0, 2]) because it is adjacent to a value of 8.

Case 3:
1. Identify objects and their persistence in the grid.
2. Recognize that there are two main objects: one with values 4, 0, and 8, and another with values 2, 0, and 3. These objects persist throughout the grid.
3. Apply transformation rules to obtain the output grid by moving the objects based on their neighboring values. For example, the first object moves right (from position [4, 0] to [0, 0]) because it is adjacent to a value of 2. The second object moves down (from position [3, 0] to [0, 2]) because it is adjacent to a value of 8.

Based on the reasoning above, here's the output for the last input:

Output:
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
