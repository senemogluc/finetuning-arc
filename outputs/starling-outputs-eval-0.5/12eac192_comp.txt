Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent numbers:
   - The first object is a group of connected 5s ([0, 5, 0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 5]).
   - The second object is a group of connected 7s and 1s ([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]).
   - The third object is a group of connected 7s ([0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]).
   - The fourth object is a group of connected 5s and 1s ([1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0]).
   - The fifth object is a group of connected 5s ([0, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1]).
   - The sixth object is a group of connected 7s ([0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]).
   - The seventh object is a group of connected 0s and 1s ([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 7]).
   - The eighth object is a group of connected 0s and 1s ([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 7]).

2. Apply transformations based on priors:
   - The first object remains unchanged as it's a group of connected 5s.
   - The second object becomes a group of connected 3s ([3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]).
   - The third object becomes a group of connected 3s and 8s ([0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3]).
   - The fourth object becomes a group of connected 3s and 8s ([3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3]).
   - The fifth object becomes a group of connected 3s ([3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]).
   - The sixth object remains unchanged as it's a group of connected 7s.
   - The seventh object becomes a group of connected 3s and 8s ([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]).
   - The eighth object becomes a group of connected 3s and 8s ([0, 3, 3, 3, 3]).

3. Combine the transformed objects to form the output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 8, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 8, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
