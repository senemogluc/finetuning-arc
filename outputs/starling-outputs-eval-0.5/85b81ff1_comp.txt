Based on the previous cases and the transformation rules derived from them, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input. The transformation rules seem to be based on recognizing and leveraging elementary geometry and topology concepts, as well as identifying goals or intentions guiding the transformations. However, without more specific information about the intended goals or intentions, it is not possible to definitively apply these rules to produce a unique output for this input.

Here are some potential outputs that could be generated by applying different transformation rules:

Output 1:
[6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Output 2:
[6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]
