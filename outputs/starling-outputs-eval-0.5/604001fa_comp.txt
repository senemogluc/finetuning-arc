Based on the provided rules and reasoning from previous cases, here's an attempt to generate the output grid for the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

This output grid is based on the assumption that the objects are connected and persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. The transformations are applied according to the rules derived from previous cases.
