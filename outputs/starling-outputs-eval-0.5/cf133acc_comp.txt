Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and transformation for each case:

Case 1:

1. The first row has 3 occurrences of 3, which form an object that persists across the entire length of the grid. This forms a horizontal line in the output grid.
2. The second row has 3 occurrences of 0, forming another horizontal line in the output grid.
3. The third and fourth rows have 3 occurrences of 3, which form two vertical lines in the output grid.
4. The fifth row has a single 0 at the beginning, forming a single pixel in the output grid.
5. The sixth row has 6, 6, and 6, forming a diagonal line in the output grid.
6. The seventh row has 6 occurrences of 6, which form two horizontal lines in the output grid.
7. The eighth row is filled with 0s, forming a single pixel in the output grid.
8. The ninth and tenth rows have 4 occurrences of 4, forming two vertical lines in the output grid.
9. The eleventh row has a single 0 at the beginning, forming a single pixel in the output grid.
10. The twelfth row has 4 occurrences of 4, which form two horizontal lines in the output grid.

Output:
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:

1. The first row has 3 occurrences of 3, forming a horizontal line in the output grid.
2. The second and third rows have 8 occurrences of 8, forming two horizontal lines in the output grid.
3. The fourth and fifth rows have 8 occurrences of 8, forming two horizontal lines in the output grid.
4. The sixth row has a single 0 at the beginning, forming a single pixel in the output grid.
5. The seventh row has 6 occurrences of 6, forming a diagonal line in the output grid.
6. The eighth row is filled with 0s, forming a single pixel in the output grid.
7. The ninth and tenth rows have 3 occurrences of 3, forming two horizontal lines in the output grid.
8. The eleventh row has a single 0 at the beginning, forming a single pixel in the output grid.
9. The twelfth row has 3 occurrences of 3, which form two horizontal lines in the output grid.
