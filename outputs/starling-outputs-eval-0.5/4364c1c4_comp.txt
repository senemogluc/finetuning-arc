Here's the reasoning for the transformation rule based on the given cases:

1. The numbers in each case are arranged in a grid with the same number adjacent to each other forming an object. This suggests that the transformation rule preserves objects formed by adjacent numbers.
2. Objects persist despite noise or occlusion, and recognition of tasks involving counting or sorting objects is important. This implies that the transformation rule should maintain the count of each unique number in the grid.
3. The presence of specific numbers like 8, 6, 4, and 2 suggests a pattern where these numbers are used to create new objects by combining adjacent numbers. For example, two 1's can combine to form a 2, two 2's can combine to form a 4, and so on.
4. The transformation rule should also consider the goal or intention of the task. In this case, it seems that the main goal is to create new objects by combining adjacent numbers.
5. Basic arithmetic and geometry concepts are not explicitly used in these cases, but they can be helpful in understanding the underlying patterns and rules.
6. The transformation rule should apply consistently across all input-output pairs.

Based on this reasoning, I propose the following transformation rule:

1. Identify adjacent numbers with the same value (e.g., 8, 8). Combine them to form a single object with a higher value (e.g., 8+8=16).
2. If an adjacent number is lower than the current object's value but has the same parity (even or odd), combine them (e.g., 4, 8 -> 12). If they have different parities, don't combine them (e.g., 3, 8).
3. For every unique number in the grid, maintain its count by adding up all instances of that number within the grid.
4. Apply this transformation rule consistently across all input-output pairs.

Now let's apply this rule to the last input:

Input:
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Output:
  [8, 8, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16]
  [8, 8, 2, 16, 8, 2, 16, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 16, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
