Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. The first row represents the background, so we can ignore it in this step.
2. We have two adjacent elements (8, 8) that are part of the same object. This forms a rectangle with the top-left corner at (0, 0). The rectangle's dimensions are 7x7 since the next row starts with 3 non-background elements.
3. In the second row, we have two groups of adjacent 8s (one with a 0 in between and another with an 8 in between). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 5x5, and the second one has dimensions 4x4.
4. In the third row, we have two groups of adjacent 8s (one with a 0 in between and another with an 8 in between). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 3x3, and the second one has dimensions 5x5.
5. In the fourth row, we have two groups of adjacent 8s (one with a 0 in between and another with an 8 in between). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 3x3, and the second one has dimensions 4x4.
6. In the fifth row, we have two groups of adjacent 0s (one with a non-zero element in between and another with a zero in between). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 5x5, and the second one has dimensions 3x3.
7. In the sixth row, we have two groups of adjacent 0s (one with a non-zero element in between and another with a zero in between). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 4x4, and the second one has dimensions 5x5.
8. In the seventh row, we have three groups of adjacent elements that are part of rectangles: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 6), and (0, 7). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 4x4, and the second one has dimensions 3x3.
9. In the eighth row, we have three groups of adjacent elements that are part of rectangles: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 6). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 4x4, and the second one has dimensions 3x3.
10. In the ninth row, we have three groups of adjacent elements that are part of rectangles: (0, 2), (0, 5), and (0, 7). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 3x4, and the second one has dimensions 3x3.

14. In the thirteenth row, we have three groups of adjacent elements that are part of rectangles: (0, 2), (0, 5), and (0, 6). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 3x4, and the second one has dimensions 3x3.
15. In the fourteenth row, we have three groups of adjacent elements that are part of rectangles: (0, 2), (0, 6), and (0, 7). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 4x3, and the second one has dimensions 3x3.
16. In the fifteenth row, we have three groups of adjacent elements that are part of rectangles: (0, 2), (0, 5), and (0, 7). These form two rectangles within the existing rectangle. The first one has dimensions 3x4, and the second one has dimensions 3x3.
