Case 3:

To find the transformation rule for this case, let's analyze the input and output pairs:

1. [3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   The first non-zero number in the input is 3. It transforms to 6 in the output. Other numbers remain unchanged.
   
2. [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   The number 2 is present twice in the input and remains unchanged in the output.
   
3. [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   The same transformation as above applies here as well.
   
4. [6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [8, 0, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6]
   The number 6 transforms to 8, and the number 8 transforms to 7. All other numbers remain unchanged.
   
5. [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0]
   The number 6 transforms to 8, and the number 7 transforms to 6. All other numbers remain unchanged.
   
6. [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
   The number 2 is present twice in the input and remains unchanged in the output.
   
7. [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
   The same transformation as above applies here as well.
   
8. [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   The number 3 transforms to 8, and the number 0 remains unchanged.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:

- If a non-zero number is adjacent to another non-zero number in the input grid, it will be transformed according to the following rules:
  - If the adjacent number is 6, it will transform to 8.
  - If the adjacent number is 7, it will transform to 6.
  - If the adjacent number is 8, it will transform to 7.
- All other numbers remain unchanged in the output grid.

Now let's apply this transformation rule to the last input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
