Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Analyze the input grids and identify patterns or rules that can be applied to transform them into the desired output grid. In this case, I notice that the numbers in the input grid are part of larger shapes, and they seem to be arranged in a specific order.
2. Identify objects within the input grid by grouping adjacent cells with the same value. For example, in the first input grid, there's a 1-shaped object at the top-left corner, a 0-shaped object at the bottom-right corner, and so on.
3. Apply transformations to each object based on the identified patterns or rules. In this case, I notice that some objects are rotated or flipped versions of others. For example, the 1-shaped object at the top-left corner is a rotated version of the 1-shaped object at the bottom-right corner.
4. Replace each object in the input grid with its transformed version and fill any gaps left by the removed objects with 0 (background). This will create the desired output grid.
5. Check whether the transformation rule works on previous input-output pairs to ensure consistency.

Based on these steps, here's the output grid for the last input grid:

[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rule applied to the input grids.
