Here's the reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to involve connecting adjacent objects with similar values. The output grid appears to be a result of merging adjacent 2s horizontally and vertically, while preserving the original grid structure.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:
The transformation rule seems to involve merging adjacent objects with similar values and preserving the original grid structure. The output grid appears to be a result of merging adjacent 2s horizontally and vertically while preserving the original grid structure.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
