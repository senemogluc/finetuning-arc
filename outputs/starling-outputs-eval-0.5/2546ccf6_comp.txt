Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation rules applied to generate the Output grid from the given Input grid:

1. Identify and group objects that are adjacent to each other with the same color value (6 in this case). In the Input grid, there are multiple instances of 6 adjacent to each other, forming separate groups. For example, the first instance is [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0].

2. Recognize and leverage the transformation rule that objects with the same color value will persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. In this case, the groups of 6's will remain intact even if they are partially obscured by other objects like 3, 2, or 0.

3. Apply the transformation rule that involves counting or sorting objects. In this case, count the number of objects in each group and place them in the Output grid accordingly. For example, for the first instance mentioned above, there are 6 elements (including the 6's at the beginning and end), so we place a single 6 in the Output grid.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all instances of objects in the Input grid. If an object is not part of any group, it will be placed directly in the Output grid without any transformation (e.g., 0's).

Here's a breakdown of the transformations applied to each instance of 6 in the Input grid:

- Instance 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0] --> [6]
- Instance 2: [3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0] --> [2, 2, 2]
- Instance 3: [0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0] --> [2, 2, 2]
- Instance 4: [0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0] --> [2, 2, 2]
- Instance 5: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] --> [6]

The Output grid is formed by placing these transformed instances of 6 in the appropriate positions based on their original locations in the Input grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
