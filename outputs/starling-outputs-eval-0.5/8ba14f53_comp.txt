Here's the reasoning for each case and the final output grid:

Case 0:
- The transformation rule focuses on recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, we can see that the 6's are connected to each other, forming a single object. The 4's and 0's also form separate objects. By considering these connections and transformations, we get the output grid:
  [4, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6]

Case 1:
- The transformation rule focuses on recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, we can see that the 8's are connected to each other, forming a single object. The 7's and 0's also form separate objects. By considering these connections and transformations, we get the output grid:
  [7, 7, 7]
  [8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
- The transformation rule focuses on recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, we can see that the 5's are connected to each other, forming a single object. The 9's and 0's also form separate objects. By considering these connections and transformations, we get the output grid:
  [9, 9, 9]
  [5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0]

Case 3:
- The transformation rule focuses on recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, we can see that the 1's are connected to each other, forming a single object. The 3's and 0's also form separate objects. By considering these connections and transformations, we get the output grid:
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 0]

Case 4:
- The transformation rule focuses on recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, we can see that the 6's are connected to each other, forming a single object. The 8's and 0's also form separate objects. By considering these connections and transformations, we get the output grid:
  [8, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]

Case 5:
- The transformation rule focuses on recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, we can see that the 8's are connected to each other, forming a single object. The 7's and 0's also form separate objects. By considering these connections and transformations, we get the output grid:
  [7, 7, 0]
  [8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0]

Case 6:
- The transformation rule focuses on recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, we can see that the 7's are connected to each other, forming a single object. The 4's and 0's also form separate objects. By considering these connections and transformations, we get the output grid:

  [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]
  [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 0, 7]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 7, 7]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
