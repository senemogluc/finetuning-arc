Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify adjacent numbers with the same value:
   - [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0] has two adjacent 1s: 1,0 and 0,1. They form an object.
   - [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] has two adjacent 1s: 1,1 and 0,1. They form an object.
   - [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] has three adjacent 0s: 0,0, 0,3 and 3,0. They form an object.
   - [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0] has two adjacent 1s: 1,0 and 0,1. They form an object.

2. Transform the grid by replacing each object with a single number representing its size or type:
   - Replace [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0] with 2 (since there are two adjacent 1s)
   - Replace [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] with 3 (since there are three adjacent 1s)
   - Replace [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] with 4 (since there are four adjacent 0s)
   - Replace [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0] with 2 (since there are two adjacent 1s)

3. The transformed grid is:

  [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]
   [1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
   [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of the last input is:

  [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
