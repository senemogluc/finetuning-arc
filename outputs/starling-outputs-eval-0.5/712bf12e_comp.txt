To determine the transformation rule for the given input-output pairs, we can analyze the patterns and relationships between objects. In this case, it seems that adjacent numbers are combined to form a new number, and then the grid is rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the last input:

1. Combine adjacent numbers:
   [0, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 5, 0, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
   [5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 2, 0, 5, 0]

2. Rotate the grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]

The output grid is:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
