Here are my reasoning steps for each option and the final output grid:

1. Considering the priors, I notice that there are repeated patterns in the input grid, specifically with the values 6 and 8. The presence of these values suggests that objects with these values are interacting or forming specific shapes.
2. The grid is primarily composed of the values 0, 6, and 8, with a few occurrences of 3 and 4 in some cases. There are no other distinct values present.
3. The input grids have a consistent structure with respect to the placement of these values, which indicates that they may represent specific objects or patterns. In this case, the presence of the values 6 and 8 suggests that there might be a transformation rule related to their arrangement.
4. I will now analyze the transformation rules for each case:

Case 0:
- The input grid has a repeating pattern with the values 8 and 3. The objects formed by these values appear to be moving horizontally, with some rotation. The objects with value 2 seem to be stationary.
- Based on this observation, I can infer that the transformation rule involves shifting and rotating the objects with values 8 and 3 while keeping the objects with value 2 fixed in place.
- Applying this rule to the input grid, I obtain the following output grid:
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]
  [2, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2]
  [2, 8, 3, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2]
  [2, 8, 3, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2]

Case 1:
- The input grid has a repeating pattern with the values 4 and 8. The objects formed by these values appear to be moving horizontally, with some rotation.
- Based on this observation, I can infer that the transformation rule involves shifting and rotating the objects with values 4 and 8 while keeping the objects with value 0 fixed in place.
- Applying this rule to the input grid, I obtain the following output grid:
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]
  [3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 3]
  [3, 8, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 8, 3]
  [3, 8, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 8, 3]
  [3, 8, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 8, 3]
  [3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Case 2:
- The input grid has a repeating pattern with the values 6 and 8. The objects formed by these values appear to be moving horizontally, with some rotation.
- Based on this observation, I can infer that the transformation rule involves shifting and rotating the objects with values 6 and 8 while keeping the objects with value 0 fixed in place.
- Applying this rule to the input grid, I obtain the following output grid:
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]
  [3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 8, 0, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 8, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 8, 0, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

In conclusion, the output grids for each case are as follows:

Case 0:
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]

  [2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
