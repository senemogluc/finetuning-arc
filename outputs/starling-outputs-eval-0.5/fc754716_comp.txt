After analyzing the previous cases and considering the priors, I can infer that the transformation rule involves expanding each object horizontally by a factor of 1. This means that if an object has a specific color in the input grid, it will be replaced with the same color repeated horizontally in the output grid.

For the last input grid:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Applying the transformation rule by expanding each object horizontally by a factor of 1:

```
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
```

So the output of the last input grid is:

```
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
```
