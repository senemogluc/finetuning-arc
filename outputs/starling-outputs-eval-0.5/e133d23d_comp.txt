To find the output grid for the last given input grid, we can follow the same steps as in previous cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. Identify objects and their relationships:
   - Object 1: [6, 0, 6, 4, 8, 8, 8] (surrounded by 6)
   - Object 2: [6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0] (surrounded by 6)
   - Object 3: [0, 6, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8] (surrounded by 6)

2. Apply transformation rules:
   - Object 1 and Object 3 have the same number of occurrences, so they are part of the same object. The numbers 8 and 0 in these objects don't affect their relationship.
   - Object 2 is also part of the same object as Objects 1 and 3 due to adjacent 6 values.
   - In the transformed grid, all three objects will be combined into a single object with the highest occurrence number (8).

3. Generate the output grid:
   - [0, 6, 6, 4, 8, 8, 8] becomes [2, 0, 2]
   - [6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0] becomes [2, 0, 2]
   - [0, 6, 0, 4, 8, 8, 0] becomes [2, 0, 2]

Output grid:
  [2, 0, 2]
  [2, 0, 2]
  [2, 0, 2]
