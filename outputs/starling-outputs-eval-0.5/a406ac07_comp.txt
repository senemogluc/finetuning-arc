Based on the given priors and transformations observed in previous cases, we can infer a possible transformation rule for the last input grid. However, it's important to note that there might be multiple valid solutions depending on the specific goal or intention guiding the transformations. Here is one possible output grid based on these observations:

Output:
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]
  [3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 7, 7]
