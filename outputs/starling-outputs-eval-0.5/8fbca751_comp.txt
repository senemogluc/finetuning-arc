Based on the provided input and transformation rules, I will generate the output grid for the last input. Here's the reasoning behind each step:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have 8x8 squares filled with 0 and 8. The 8s form a square pattern in the center of the grid. There are no other objects or interactions between them.
2. Apply the transformation rule: Since there is no noise or occlusion, the transformation will involve counting and basic arithmetic to determine how many 8s are present in each row and column, as well as in the entire grid. We can also notice that the square pattern formed by the 8s has a size of 4x4.

Here's the output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
