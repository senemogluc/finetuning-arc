The output for the last input is:

  [0, 7, 7, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here are the steps to arrive at this output:

1. Identify and group objects with the same color value (5).
   [0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   => [0, 0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 4, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   => [0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ...
   
2. Transform the grid by applying the rules:
   a. If two adjacent objects have the same color value, merge them into one object with that color value.
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] => [0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      [0, 6, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] => [0, 6, 6, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      ...
   
   b. If two adjacent objects with the same color value have a different number of occurrences, merge them into one object with the sum of their color values.
      [0, 7, 7, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] => [0, 7, 7, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      ...
   
3. The final output grid is the result of these transformations:
  [0, 7, 7, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]
