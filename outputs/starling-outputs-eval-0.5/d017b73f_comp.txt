Here are my reasoning steps for each case:

Case 0:
- Objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Persistence and transformations are not significant in this case.
- The goal is to maintain the same structure as the input grid, but merge objects with the same number.
- Merge the following objects: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)

Output:
  [0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:
- Objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Persistence and transformations are not significant in this case.
- The goal is to maintain the same structure as the input grid, but merge objects with the same number.
- Merge the following objects: (2,1), (3,1), (3,4), (3,5)

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2]
  [0, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2]

Case 2:
- Objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Persistence and transformations are not significant in this case.
- The goal is to maintain the same structure as the input grid, but merge objects with the same number.
- Merge the following objects: (2,1), (2,3), (8,5), (8,6)

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 6, 6]
  [0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Case 3:
- Objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Persistence and transformations are not significant in this case.
- The goal is to maintain the same structure as the input grid, but merge objects with the same number.
- Merge the following objects: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)

Output:
  [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2]
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 4:
- Objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Persistence and transformations are not significant in this case.
- The goal is to maintain the same structure as the input grid, but merge objects with the same number.
- Merge the following objects: (2,1), (2,3)

Output:
  [0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 5]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The last input's output is:

  [0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 5]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
