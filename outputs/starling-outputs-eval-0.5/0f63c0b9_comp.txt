Here are some key observations from the given cases:

1. Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
2. Objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects, compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
4. Elementary geometry and topology concepts are applied, such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
5. Transformations like rotation, scaling, or reflection might be involved in the output grid. 
6. The output grid can be larger or smaller than the input grid.

Based on these observations and the given input:

Case 0:
Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Case 1:
Output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Case 2:
Output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Case 3:
Output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Case 4:
Output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
