Here's a step-by-step explanation of the transformation rules applied to this grid in order to obtain the output grid:

1. The first row contains only zeros (0) and does not change.
2. In the second row, all elements are 6's (6). These 6's can be considered as representing a single entity. So, we merge them into a single entity with a value of 6.
3. In the third row, all elements are 8's (8). We merge these 8's into a single entity with a value of 8.
4. In the fourth row, all elements are 1's (1). We merge them into a single entity with a value of 1.
5. The fifth and sixth rows have similar patterns to the third and fourth rows. They are merged accordingly.
6. The seventh row is just zeros (0) and does not change.
7. In the eighth row, all elements are 4's (4). We merge them into a single entity with a value of 4.
8. In the ninth to twelfth rows, we have a repeating pattern of four 4's (4) followed by a zero (0), and then another set of four 4's (4). We merge these patterns into two separate entities with a value of 4.
9. The thirteenth row is just zeros (0) and does not change.
10. In the fourteenth to seventeenth rows, we have a repeating pattern of four 4's (4), followed by a zero (0), and then another set of four 4's (4). We merge these patterns into two separate entities with a value of 4.
11. The eighteenth row is just zeros (0) and does not change.
12. In the nineteenth to twenty-second rows, we have a repeating pattern of four 4's (4), followed by a zero (0), and then another set of four 4's (4). We merge these patterns into two separate entities with a value of 4.
13. The twentieth row is just zeros (0) and does not change.
14. In the twenty-first to twenty-fourth rows, we have a repeating pattern of four 4's (4), followed by a zero (0), and then another set of four 4's (4). We merge these patterns into two separate entities with a value of 4.
15. The twenty-fifth row is just zeros (0) and does not change.
16. In the twenty-sixth to twenty-ninth rows, we have a repeating pattern of four 4's (4), followed by a zero (0), and then another set of four 4's (4). We merge these patterns into two separate entities with a value of 4.
17. The thirtieth row is just zeros (0) and does not change.
18. In the thirty-first to thirty-fourth rows, we have a repeating pattern of four 4's (4), followed by a zero (0), and then another set of four 4's (4). We merge these patterns into two separate entities with a value of 4.
19. The thirty-fifth row is just zeros (0) and does not change.
20. In the thirty-sixth to thirty-ninth rows, we have a repeating pattern of four 4's (4), followed by a zero (0), and then another set of four 4's (4). We merge these patterns into two separate entities with a value of 4.
21. The fortieth row is just zeros (0) and does not change.

The output grid after applying the transformation rules is:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
