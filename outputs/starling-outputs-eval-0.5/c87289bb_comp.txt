Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on their colors (numbers) in the input grid. In this case, we have a single object with color 8, which forms a rectangle shape.
2. The transformation rule involves moving the entire object horizontally by one unit to the right while maintaining its shape and size.
3. Apply the transformation rule to each row of the input grid:
   - For rows containing the object (8s), move the 8s one unit to the right.
   - For rows not containing the object, keep them unchanged.
4. The final output grid after applying the transformation rule is as follows:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
