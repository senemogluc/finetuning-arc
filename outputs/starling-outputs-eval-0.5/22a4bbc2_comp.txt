Based on the provided transformation rules and previous outputs, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the given input. However, I can provide an analysis of the input and suggest a possible output based on some assumptions. 

Here's an analysis of the input grid:
- The grid is symmetric along both horizontal and vertical axes. 
- There are four main sections: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. Each section has a pattern of alternating 8s and 0s.
- In each section, there's an object with the shape of a square consisting of 3x3 elements (including the center). The squares are centered around the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).

Based on these observations, we can create a possible output grid by mirroring the input grid along both horizontal and vertical axes:

Output:
  [8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 8, 8, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1]
  [8, 8, 8, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8]
  [1, 1, 1, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 1, 1]

Please note that this output is only a suggestion based on the symmetry of the input grid. The actual transformation rule might be different and lead to a different output.
