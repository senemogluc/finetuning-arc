To determine the transformation rule, we can analyze the given cases and identify patterns. In all cases, the input grid has a central object (2s) surrounded by a border of background (0s). The main transformation that occurs in each case is the movement or rearrangement of these central objects while maintaining their shape and size.

In Case 1, the central object moves diagonally up-right.
In Case 2, the central object moves diagonally down-left.
In Case 3, the central object moves horizontally to the right.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is to move the central object in a specific direction relative to its original position. However, without more information about the desired output for the last input case, it's impossible to determine the exact transformation rule or output grid.
