Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [...]

   Output:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

   Here, all the input values are either 0 or 1. The transformation rule should be to keep all objects with the same adjacent values together and remove any single 0s. In this case, there are no single 0s, so the output is the same as the input.

2. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
   [...]

   Output:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

   Here, the transformation rule should be to keep all objects with the same adjacent values together and remove any single 0s. The input grid is a combination of several smaller objects (e.g., [1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]) separated by single 0s. According to the transformation rule, we should keep these objects together and remove any single 0s between them. However, since all the input values are either 0 or 1, the output is just a grid of 0s.

3. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
   [...]

   Output:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

   Here's the same reasoning as in step 2. The output is a grid of 0s.
