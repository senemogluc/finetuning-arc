Based on the transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input. The transformation rules focus on recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects, counting or sorting objects, and object relationships. However, the given input does not provide clear connections between adjacent numbers, making it challenging to apply these rules consistently.

Here are two possible outputs based on different interpretations of the input:

Output 1:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output 2:
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Both outputs are valid interpretations of the input based on different assumptions about the relationships between adjacent numbers. Since there is no clear way to apply the transformation rules to this specific input, it's impossible to determine a unique output that satisfies all the given cases and priors.
