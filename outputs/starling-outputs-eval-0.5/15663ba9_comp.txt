Here are the steps to determine the transformation rule and generate the output grid for the last input:

1. Identify objects in the input grid: There are two main objects in the input grid, one with a pattern of 3s (3, 0, 3) and another with a pattern of 4s (4, 3, 4). The background is represented by 0.
2. Analyze object relationships: The 3-patterned object has a horizontal translation of 1 unit to the right in each row, while the 4-patterned object has a vertical translation of 1 unit down in each column.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:

- Translate the 3-patterned object horizontally by 1 unit to the right for each row.
- Translate the 4-patterned object vertically by 1 unit down for each column.

Applying this transformation rule to the last input grid, we get the following output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
