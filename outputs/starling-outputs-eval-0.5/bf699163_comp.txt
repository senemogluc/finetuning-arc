Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing and leveraging elementary geometry and topology concepts. In this case, it seems like the objects are being rotated or flipped around a central axis. 

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Observe the input grid and identify objects with similar numbers that are adjacent to each other.
2. Identify the central axis of rotation for each object. For example, in the last input grid, we can see that the object with number 7 at position (8, 6) is rotated around its central axis (position (8, 6)).
3. Rotate or flip objects around their central axes to achieve a new configuration while preserving the relationships between objects. For example, in the last input grid, we can rotate the object with number 7 at position (8, 6) around its central axis (position (8, 6)) to obtain the output grid:

Output:
  [5, 2, 2]
  [5, 5, 5]
  [5, 5, 5]

This output is consistent with the transformation rule and previous cases.
