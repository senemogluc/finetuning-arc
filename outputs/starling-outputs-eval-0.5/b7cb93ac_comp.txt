Given the last input grid and considering the transformation rules, we can generate the following output grid:

Output:
  [6, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 8, 8, 8]
  [6, 8, 0, 8]

This output grid is based on the assumption that the 8s are part of a larger object and that the 3s and 6s are separate objects. The transformation rule is applied by identifying the relationships between the numbers, their persistence, and the physical contact between them.
