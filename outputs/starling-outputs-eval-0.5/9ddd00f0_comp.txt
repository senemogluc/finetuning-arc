Here are my thoughts on the transformation rules and reasoning for each case:

Case 0: The grid has a repeating pattern of 2x3 blocks with value 2 surrounded by zeros. It seems like the transformation rule here is to maintain this pattern, but only include the values of 2 in the output grid while filling in the gaps with zeros.

Case 1: The input grid shows two objects made of the number 8 connected horizontally and vertically. The transformation rule here is to maintain these connections between the 8s while keeping the shape intact.

Case 2: This grid has a more complex pattern, but it appears that the main transformation rule is to keep the horizontal and vertical connections between the numbers 1 and 0 intact, as well as maintaining the number of 1s in each row.

Now, I will apply these rules to generate the output grid for the last input:

Output:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid for the last input is as follows:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
