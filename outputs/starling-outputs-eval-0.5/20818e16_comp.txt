Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the objects and their attributes in the input grid. In this case, there are two types of objects: squares with a single number (1) and squares with two numbers (2, 3). The squares with a single number form a grid of size 4x4, while the squares with two numbers form a grid of size 2x2 inside the main grid.
2. Analyze the transformation rules applied in previous cases. The main transformation is to merge objects that are adjacent and have the same value (e.g., merging two squares with a single number). Additionally, the output grid may be smaller or larger than the input grid.
3. Apply the transformation rules step by step:
   a. Merge all squares with the same value that are adjacent to each other. This results in a new grid of size 4x4 with merged objects. The merged values are the sum of the original values (e.g., 1+1=2, 2+2=4).
   b. For each row, if there is an even number of squares with two numbers, place one in the middle square and remove the other. If there is an odd number of squares with two numbers, remove the extra square(s) without placing any in the middle. This step results in a grid of size 4x4 with alternating single and double numbers.
   c. For each row, if there are only single-number squares, place one in the middle square and remove the other. If there is an odd number of single-number squares, remove the extra square(s) without placing any in the middle. This step results in a grid of size 4x3 with alternating single and double numbers.
   d. For rows with only double-number squares, keep them as they are.
4. The resulting output grid is:

   [2, 2, 2, 2]
   [2, 8, 8, 8]
   [2, 8, 8, 8]
   [2, 8, 8, 8]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rules applied in previous cases and maintains the persistence of objects.
