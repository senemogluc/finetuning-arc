Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to generate the output grid for the last given input grid using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs:

1. Identify objects with the same number that are adjacent to each other:
   - In the first row, there are three 0's and one 1. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the second row, there are two 0's and one 1. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the third row, there is one 1 and three 3's. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the fourth row, there are six 2's, six 4's, and six 6's. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the fifth row, there are three 0's and one 1. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the sixth row, there is one 1. This object is disconnected from other objects.
   - In the seventh row, there are six 2's, six 4's, and six 6's. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the eighth row, there are three 0's, one 1, and three 3's. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the ninth row, there is one 0 and one 1. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the tenth row, there are three 0's and one 1. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the eleventh row, there are three 3's and one 4. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the twelfth row, there are six 4's and six 6's. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the thirteenth row, there are three 0's, one 1, and three 3's. Treat them as separate objects.
   - In the fourteenth row, there are three 0's and one 1. Treat them as separate objects.

2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects:
   - Count the number of objects in each group and their respective values.
   - For example, in the first row, there are four 0's and two 1's.

3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined:
   - Identify and analyze the positions of the objects in the grid.
   - Pay attention to object relationships, transformations, and persistence.

4. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one:
   - Based on the analysis of the input grid and the transformation rules, determine which objects can be merged or transformed.
   - For example, in the first row, the 0's and 1's can be combined to form a single object with values [0, 2, 1].

5. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs:
   - Verify that the generated output grid is consistent with the transformation rules applied to the previous cases.

Following these steps, we can generate the output grid for the last given input grid as follows:

Output:
  [0, 2, 1]
  [2, 0, 1]
  [0, 2, 0]
  [6, 6, 6]
  [6, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 1]
  [6, 6, 6]
  [0, 2, 0]
  [2, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0]
  [6, 6, 6]
  [6, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rules applied to the previous cases.
