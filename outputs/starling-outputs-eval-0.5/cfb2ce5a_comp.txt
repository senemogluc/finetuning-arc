Here are the steps to derive the transformation rule and apply it to the given input grid:

1. Identify the same numbers that are adjacent to each other. In this case, we can see that the 4s and 8s in the first row form separate objects, as do the 1s, 4s, and 5 in the fourth row. The 6 in the fifth row forms a single object with itself, while the 7 in the sixth row forms an object with itself.
2. Apply the transformation rule based on the relationships between these objects. For example, the 8s in the first row are transformed by adding 1 to their values (becoming 9s), and the 4s in the fourth row are transformed by subtracting 1 from their values (becoming 3s). The 6 in the fifth row is transformed by multiplying its value by 2 (becoming 12), while the 7 in the sixth row remains unchanged.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all rows, considering the connections between objects and their transformations. For example, the 4s and 8s in the first row are connected horizontally, so they remain adjacent in the output grid. The 1s, 4s, and 5s in the fourth row are also connected horizontally, so their positions are preserved in the output grid.
4. Apply the transformation rule to each object and position them accordingly in the output grid. In this case, the transformed objects are as follows:

   - The 8s in the first row become 9s: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 0]
   - The 4s and 1s in the fourth row become 3s and 2s: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The 4s and 4s in the fourth row become 3s and 3s: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The 1s in the fifth row become 3s: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The 4s and 5s in the fourth row become 3s and 4s: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 1, 4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 2, 0]
   - The 6 in the fifth row becomes 12: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 1, 4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 2, 0]
   - The 7 in the sixth row remains unchanged: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 1, 4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 2, 0]

The output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 0],
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0],
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 4, 1, 4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 2, 0]
