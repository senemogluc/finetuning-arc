Here's a breakdown of the steps taken to reach the final output grid:

1. Identify adjacent objects and merge them if they are the same color (objects with the same value). This step can be done by iterating through all pairs of adjacent objects, checking if their colors are equal, and merging them into one object with a higher count.
2. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry concepts as tools to determine relationships between objects. Here, we can use the fact that an object's position relative to its neighbors is important for determining whether it should be merged with adjacent objects or not.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. In this case, we count the number of times an object appears in a row, column, or diagonal. If an object has the same color as an adjacent object, merge them into one object. If not, keep them separate.
4. Pick another object and repeat steps 1-3 until all objects have been processed or no more merging is possible.
5. Output the resulting grid, with merged objects represented by their count. For example, if two identical objects are merged into a single object, the resulting object will be represented as (2, 2), indicating that there were originally two of them.
