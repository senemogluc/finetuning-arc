Here are my reasoning steps for generating the output grid:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid and their properties. In this case, we have different colored squares (numbers) arranged in a rectangular grid with some gaps between them. The objects seem to be part of larger structures that can be transformed or rotated.
2. Determine the transformation rule based on the priors. Since the objects are part of larger structures and have consistent properties, we can assume that they persist despite noise or occlusion. Also, we should recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects, comparing numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
3. Apply the transformation rule to the input grid. Based on the priors, we can try to fill in the gaps between the objects while maintaining their consistency. This involves rotating and translating the objects to fit into the grid.
4. Check whether the transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs. The transformation should be consistent across all cases.
5. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid, but it should maintain the consistency of the objects and their properties.

After applying these steps, here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
