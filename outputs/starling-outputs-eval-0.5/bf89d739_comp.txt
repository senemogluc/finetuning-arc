Here's the reasoning for each step of the transformation rule induction:

1. Case 1:
   - Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     This is a row of zeros with no adjacent values that are the same. There's nothing to transform here. The output will be the same as the input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
   
2. Case 2:
   - Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     This is a row of zeros with no adjacent values that are the same. There's nothing to transform here. The output will be the same as the input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
   
3. Case 3:
   - Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     This is a row of zeros with no adjacent values that are the same. There's nothing to transform here. The output will be the same as the input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
   
4. Case 4:
   - Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     This is a row of zeros with no adjacent values that are the same. There's nothing to transform here. The output will be the same as the input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

As you can see from the reasoning above, all the cases result in the same output as their respective inputs. Therefore, the output of the last input is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
