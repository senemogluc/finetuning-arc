Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the output grid should be a simplified version of the input grid. In this case, the transformation seems to remove adjacent objects with the same value, leaving only one instance of each object. Here's the reasoning step by step:

1. The first row has 5's along the diagonal and in the middle. These are merged into a single 5.
2. In the second row, there are 4's above the 0's and 5's. These form a diamond shape with the 0's as the base. The 4's merge into a single 4.
3. In the third row, there are 2's along the diagonal and in the middle. These are merged into a single 2.
4. In the fourth row, there are 2's above the 0's and 5's. These form a diamond shape with the 0's as the base. The 2's merge into a single 2.
5. In the fifth row, there are 2's along the diagonal and in the middle. These are merged into a single 2.
6. In the sixth row, there is a single 1 at the center. It remains unchanged.
7. In the seventh row, there are no adjacent objects with the same value, so it remains unchanged as well.
8. In the eighth row, there are 0's along the diagonal and in the middle. These merge into a single 0. The 5's around the 0's form an L-shape, but they don't merge due to the transformation rule.
9. In the ninth row, there are 3's along the diagonal and in the middle. These are merged into a single 3.
10. The last row is empty and remains unchanged.

Here's the output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 6, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
