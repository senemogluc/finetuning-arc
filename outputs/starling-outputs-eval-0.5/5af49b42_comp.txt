Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify adjacent same-colored objects:
   - In the input grid, we can identify the following adjacent same-colored objects:
     - (0, 0) and (0, 1) with color 3
     - (0, 2) and (0, 3) with color 4
     - (0, 5) and (0, 6) with color 6
     - (0, 8) and (0, 9) with color 8
     - (1, 1) and (1, 2) with color 3
     - (1, 4) and (1, 5) with color 4
     - (1, 7) and (1, 8) with color 6
     - (1, 9) and (1, 10) with color 8
     - (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5) with color 3
     - (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9) with color 6
     - (2, 10), (2, 11) with color 8
     - (3, 4) and (3, 5) with color 4
     - (3, 7) and (3, 8) with color 6
     - (3, 9) and (3, 10) with color 8
     - (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4) with color 3
     - (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9) with color 6
     - (4, 10), (4, 11) with color 8
     - (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4) with color 4
     - (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9) with color 6

   Based on these adjacent same-colored objects, we can identify the following objects:
   1. Object 1: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color 3)
   2. Object 2: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color 4)
   3. Object 3: [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color 6)
   4. Object 4: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color 8)
   5. Object 5: [3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color 3)
   6. Object 6: [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color 4)

2. Transform the grid based on the identified objects:
   - Based on the identified objects and their locations, we can transform the grid as follows:
     [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output Grid:
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
