Here are the steps to derive the transformation rule and apply it to the last input.

1. Identify adjacent objects with the same color (value) and group them together.
2. Count the number of occurrences of each object and use this count as a multiplier for the object's value in the output grid.
3. If an object is part of multiple groups, apply the transformation rule to each group separately and combine the results.
4. If there are overlapping objects with different colors (values), apply the transformation rule to each object individually.
5. For counting or sorting objects, consider the total number of occurrences of each object in the entire grid.
6. Apply basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication as necessary.
7. If multiple transformations are needed, apply them sequentially to obtain the final output grid.
8. Check if the transformation rule can be applied to previous input-output pairs as well. If not, reconsider the transformation rule based on the given cases.

Now let's apply these steps to the last input:

1. Identify adjacent objects with the same color (value):
   [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3]
   Each group has a single object with value 3.

2. Count the number of occurrences of each object and use this count as a multiplier for the object's value in the output grid:
   [3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]

3. Since there are no overlapping objects with different colors, we can skip this step.
4. No other transformations needed.
5. Counting or sorting objects is not necessary in this case.
6. Apply basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication as necessary: None needed here.
7. If multiple transformations are needed, apply them sequentially to obtain the final output grid: The output grid is already obtained in step 2.
8. Check if the transformation rule can be applied to previous input-output pairs: It can be applied to all previous cases.

The output of the last input is:
[3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]
