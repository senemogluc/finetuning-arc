Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the given input grid to get the output grid.

1. Identify objects with the same values adjacent to each other and group them together, considering their persistence. In this case, we can see that the 3's are connected: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), ... (0, 9). Similarly, the 4's are connected: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), ... (1, 8), and the 2's are connected: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), ... (3, 7).

2. Count the number of objects in each group. In this case, we have 6 groups with 3 elements each, and one group with 4 elements.

3. Transform the grid by replacing each group with a single element that represents the count of the original group. For example, replace the 3's with 6 (as there are 6 of them), and the 4's with 4 (as there are 4 of them). In this case, we will have:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

4. The final output grid is the transformed grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
