Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify groups of same numbers adjacent to each other as part of the same object: 
   - In the first row, there are two separate objects with 2s (2,2) and one single 0. 
   - In the second row, there is a group of (2,2) and one single 0. 
   - In the third row, there's a group of (2,2), a single 0, another group of (2,2), and a single 0. 
   - In the fourth row, there are two separate objects with 2s (2,2) and one single 0. 
   - In the fifth row, there's a group of (2,2), a single 0, another group of (2,2), and a single 0. 
   - In the sixth row, there are two separate objects with 2s (2,2) and one single 0. 

2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects: 
   - The first and fourth rows have two groups of (2,2). 
   - The second and fifth rows have a group of (2,2) and a single 0. 
   - The third row has two groups of (2,2) separated by a single 0. 
   - The sixth row has two groups of (2,2). 

3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects: 
   - In the first and fourth rows, each group of (2,2) will be replaced with an 8 (2+2=4, 4*2=8). 
   - In the second and fifth rows, the group of (2,2) will be replaced with an 8, and the single 0 will remain as is. 
   - In the third row, each group of (2,2) will be replaced with an 8, and the single 0 in between will remain as is. 
   - In the sixth row, each group of (2,2) will be replaced with an 8. 

4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: 
   - The groups of (2,2) are connected horizontally, so they can be transformed into a single object with an equal number of 8s in their place. 
   - Single 0s are not part of any group and remain as is. 

5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: 
   - For the first row, replace the two (2,2) groups with a single 8, resulting in [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. 
   - For the second and fifth rows, replace the group of (2,2) with an 8, and keep the single 0 as is: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] and [8, 8, 0, 0, 0]. 
   - For the third row, replace each group of (2,2) with an 8, keeping the single 0 in between: [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]. 
   - For the sixth row, replace each group of (2,2) with an 8: [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]. 

6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: 
   - The transformation works consistently for all previous input-output pairs.

Final Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]
