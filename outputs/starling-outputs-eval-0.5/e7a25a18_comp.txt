Here are the steps to arrive at the output grid:

1. Identify adjacent numbers that form a single object in the input grid:
   - In the first row, we have 2s adjacent to each other, forming a single object.
   - In the second row, there are no adjacent numbers with the same value.
   - In the third row, we have 0s and 3s adjacent to each other, forming separate objects.
   - In the fourth row, we have 2s and 3s adjacent to each other, forming a single object.
   - In the fifth row, there are no adjacent numbers with the same value.
   - In the sixth row, we have 1s adjacent to each other, forming a single object.
   - In the seventh row, we have 1s adjacent to each other, forming a single object.
   - In the eighth row, we have 2s and 4s adjacent to each other, forming separate objects.
   - In the ninth row, we have 2s and 4s adjacent to each other, forming separate objects.
   - In the tenth row, we have 2s adjacent to each other, forming a single object.
   - In the eleventh row, we have 2s adjacent to each other, forming a single object.
   - In the twelfth row, we have 2s and 3s adjacent to each other, forming separate objects.
   - In the thirteenth row, we have 2s and 3s adjacent to each other, forming separate objects.
   - In the fourteenth row, we have 2s adjacent to each other, forming a single object.

2. Apply the transformation rule by considering the persistence of objects:
   - The 0s in the input grid can be considered as background and are not part of any object. They can be removed from the output grid.
   - The 2s in the first, third, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and fourteenth rows form a single object and persist throughout the transformation. They appear in the same positions in the output grid.
   - The 3s in the third row are part of a single object that moves down one row in the output grid.
   - The 4s in the eighth and ninth rows are part of separate objects that move down two rows in the output grid.

3. Apply the transformation to the input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [3, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0]
  [3, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0]
  [6, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0]
  [6, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

The output grid for the last given input is:

  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [3, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0]
  [3, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0]
  [6, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0]
  [6, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
