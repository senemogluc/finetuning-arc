Here are my reasoning steps and final output for the last input case:

1. Analyze the input grid and look for patterns or relationships between adjacent numbers. In this case, we can observe that there are groups of 8s in the input grid with the same number of empty spaces around them (either 4 or 6). This suggests that the transformation rule might involve moving these groups of 8s to different locations in the grid.
2. Identify the goal or intention for the transformation. In this case, it seems like the goal is to create a pattern with the numbers and empty spaces around them while maintaining the same number of elements (numbers + empty spaces) in each group.
3. Apply the identified goal to the input grid. Based on the observation from step 1, we can try moving the groups of 8s to different locations in the grid while keeping the same number of elements in each group. Here's one possible transformation:

   Input:
   
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

   Output:
   
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0
     0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
     0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1
     0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1
     0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1
     0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

4. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs. Since there are no previous input-output pairs provided, it's difficult to determine if this transformation is consistent across all cases. However, based on the reasoning and analysis above, this transformation rule seems reasonable for the given input grid. 

Final output for the last input:
