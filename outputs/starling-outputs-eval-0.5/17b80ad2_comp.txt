Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify adjacent objects with the same value:
   - [2, 3], [6, 1], [8, 9] are adjacent pairs
   - [4, 0], [7, 0], [8, 9] are adjacent pairs

2. Transform objects that are not part of a larger object:
   - [2, 3] becomes [2, 4]
   - [6, 1] becomes [6, 2]
   - [8, 9] becomes [8, 10]

3. Transform objects that are part of a larger object:
   - [4, 0], [7, 0], and [8, 9] are part of the same object, so we can merge them into one object:
     [4, 0, 7, 0, 8, 9]

4. Replace transformed objects with their new values in the grid:
   - Input: [0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 9, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8]
     Output: [0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 10, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 8]

Final Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 10, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 8]
