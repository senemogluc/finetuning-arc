Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and transformation for the last input grid:

1. Identify objects and their persistence:
   - The main objects are represented by 9, 2, and 6. These numbers persist throughout the grid.
   - Each object has a size of at least 3x3 (as they can be separated by a single cell).

2. Analyze relationships between objects:
   - Objects of the same type are connected horizontally or vertically, forming rows and columns.
   - The grid appears to have a checkerboard pattern, alternating between object 9 and object 6.

3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic:
   - Counting the number of occurrences of each object in the grid, we get:
     - Object 9: 27 times (as it's part of the 9x9 grid)
     - Object 6: 15 times (as it appears in rows and columns with a spacing of 3 cells)
     - Object 2: 6 times (as it appears at the top-left corner of each object 9)

4. Recognize geometric patterns and apply transformations:
   - The grid has a checkerboard pattern, alternating between object 9 and object 6. This can be seen as a combination of horizontal and vertical stripes.
   - The spacing between objects of the same type is consistent (3 cells).

5. Apply the transformation rule to generate the output grid:
   - Based on the analysis, the output grid should have the same checkerboard pattern with alternating object 9 and object 6, separated by a single cell.

Here's the output grid for the last input:

  [9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 6, 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9]
  [9, 9, 2, 2, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 2, 2, 9, 9]
  [1, 2, 1, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 7, 1, 2, 1]
  [9, 2, 7, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1, 7, 2, 9]
  [9, 6, 6, 4, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 4, 6, 6, 9]
  [6, 6, 2, 2, 6, 8, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 2, 6, 6]
  [6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6]
  [4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 6, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 2, 4]
  [4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 6, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 2, 4]
  [6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6]
  [6, 6, 2, 2, 6, 8, 6, 2, 2, 6, 8, 6, 2, 2, 6, 6]
  [9, 6, 6, 4, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 4, 6, 6, 9]
  [9, 2, 7, 1, 4, 2, 6, 2, 2, 6, 2, 4, 1, 7, 2, 9]
  [1, 2, 1, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 7, 1, 2, 1]
  [9, 9, 2, 2, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 2, 2, 9, 9, 9]
  [9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 6, 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9]

This output grid follows the same pattern and relationships as the input grid, preserving the checkerboard pattern with alternating object 9 and object 6, separated by a single cell.
