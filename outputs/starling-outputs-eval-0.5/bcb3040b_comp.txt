Here's the reasoning for each option and then the final output grid:

Option 1:
- Merge objects horizontally or vertically if they are adjacent and have the same color.
- Preserve objects with different colors even if they are adjacent.
- Counting objects and their positions may help in determining the transformation rule, but it's not necessary for this case.

Output:
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
