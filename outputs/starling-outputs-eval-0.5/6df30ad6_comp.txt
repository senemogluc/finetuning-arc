Based on the given priors and previous transformations, it's difficult to determine a unique output grid for the last input. However, we can attempt to apply some general principles to generate an output grid. Here's one possible approach:

1. Identify and separate objects based on their values (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
2. For each object, find the largest connected component of that object in the input grid.
3. Transform each connected component by translating or rotating it to create a new pattern.
4. Replace the original connected components with the transformed ones in the output grid.
5. Fill in the remaining cells with zeros (background).

Using this approach, we can generate an output grid as follows:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that this output grid is just one possible interpretation based on the given priors and previous transformations.
