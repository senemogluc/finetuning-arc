Here's a step-by-step reasoning for this case:

1. The first three rows seem to be part of an object with three squares of value 2 and one square of value 7 in each row. This object appears to be rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise in each row.
2. The fourth row contains two copies of the same pattern: a single square of value 1, surrounded by four squares of value 0. It's possible that these patterns will merge into one larger pattern in the output grid.
3. The fifth and sixth rows are filled with 5s, which doesn't seem to have any clear pattern or connection with the previous rows.
4. The last row contains two copies of the same pattern: a single square of value 1, surrounded by four squares of value 0. This is similar to the fourth row, but not identical, suggesting they may be part of different objects that will merge in the output grid.
5. The seventh and eighth rows are filled with 5s, which doesn't seem to have any clear pattern or connection with the previous rows.
6. The ninth row is also filled with 5s and doesn't seem to have any clear pattern or connection with the previous rows.
7. The last three rows contain only 1s, which doesn't seem to have any clear pattern or connection with the previous rows. However, it's possible that they are part of a larger pattern in the output grid.
8. Based on these observations, we can infer that the main objects in the input grid are rotated versions of each other and will merge into a single object in the output grid. The 5s seem unrelated to this process, but their presence might be due to some other underlying pattern or transformation rule not considered here.
9. Since there's no clear pattern for the 1s at the bottom of the grid, it's difficult to predict how they will affect the output grid. However, since they are part of the main objects that will merge in the output grid, we can expect some changes in their positions and values.
10. Based on these considerations, the output grid could be formed by merging the rotated versions of the main object, with the 5s being unaffected by this process. However, without more information or a specific transformation rule, it's not possible to provide an exact output grid.
