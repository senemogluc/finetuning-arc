Based on the transformation rules induced from the previous cases, we can generate the following Output grid for the last given Input grid:

  [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rules and maintains the relationships between objects in the input grid.
