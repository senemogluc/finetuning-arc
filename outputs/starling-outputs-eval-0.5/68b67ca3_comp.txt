To determine the transformation rule, we can analyze the given cases and identify patterns. Here's a summary of the observations from the previous cases:

1. The same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
2. Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. In many cases, objects from the input persist in the output grid, often in a transformed form.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
5. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
6. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined.
7. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one.
8. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs.
9. The output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is to group adjacent numbers and simplify the grid while maintaining the relationships between the objects. 

For the last input:

Input:
  [3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Applying the transformation rule:

Output:
  [3, 4]
  [7, 1]
  [7, 1]

This output respects the given priors and works on the previous input-output pairs.
