Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid based on adjacent numbers with the same value. For example, the first object consists of [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], and the second object consists of [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0].
2. Transform each object based on its relationship to other objects in the grid, considering physical contact, translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements. For example, the first object [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0] is transformed into [3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3].
3. Replace the input grid with the transformed objects to create the output grid.

Here's the final output grid for the last input:

[3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1]
[2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3]
[2, 1, 3, 3, 5, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2]
[1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2]
[2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3]
[3, 2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2]
[2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 5, 1, 3]
[3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1]

This output grid is based on the transformation rules induced from the previous input-output pairs and considering the priors mentioned earlier.
