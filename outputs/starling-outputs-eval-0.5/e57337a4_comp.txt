To determine the transformation rule, we can analyze the previous cases and identify patterns. In each case, the output grid has a smaller size than the input grid, with some numbers replaced by zeros. The zeros appear to be located on the edges of the input grid, particularly near where two objects meet or overlap.

For the last input, we can apply the same transformation rule as in previous cases:

1. Identify adjacent numbers that are part of the same object (in this case, 6's).
2. Replace some of these numbers with zeros, particularly near where two objects meet or overlap.
3. The output grid will have a smaller size than the input grid and will contain zeros in the appropriate locations.

Here's the transformation for the last input:

Input:
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Output:
  [0, 6, 6]
  [6, 0, 6]
  [6, 6, 6]

In this case, we replaced the zeros with 6's to maintain consistency with previous cases. The output grid has a smaller size than the input grid and contains zeros in the appropriate locations.
