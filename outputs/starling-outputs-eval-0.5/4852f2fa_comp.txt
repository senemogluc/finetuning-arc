Case 5:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To generate the output grid for this input, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects and their persistence: There are two main objects in the input grid - the first one is a combination of 8's (8, 8), and the second one is a single 4. Both objects persist through the output grid.
2. Analyze object relationships and transformations: The 8's form a rectangle shape with dimensions 3x2, while the 4 forms a separate rectangle with dimensions 1x1. There are no physical interactions between these two objects.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Since there are three rows of 8's in the input grid, and they are all adjacent, we can create a single row of 8's in the output grid by stacking them vertically. The 4 remains unchanged.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: As mentioned earlier, the 8's form a rectangle shape with dimensions 3x2, and the 4 forms a separate rectangle with dimensions 1x1. No topological changes are needed for these objects.
5. Write down reasoning for each option and then pick one: In this case, we can create a single row of 8's in the output grid by stacking them vertically, and place the 4 next to it. This maintains the integrity of both objects while creating a more compact representation.
6. Check whether the transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation works for all previous cases, as the output grids match the expected results.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
