Based on the priors provided and the previous cases, it seems that the transformation rule involves grouping adjacent objects with the same number and then replicating those groups across the grid. Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the groups of adjacent objects with the same number in the input grid. In this case, we have two main groups: 
   - [5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5] and [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]

2. Replicate each group across the grid while maintaining their relative positions. 
   - The first group's replication would look like this:
     [5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5]
     [5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5]
     [5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5]
   - The second group's replication would look like this:
     [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]

3. Combine the replicated groups to form the output grid:
   Output:

      [5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5]
      [5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5]
      [5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5]
      [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
      [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
      [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
      [2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 1, 2, 5]
      [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      [5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 1]
