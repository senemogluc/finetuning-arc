Based on the previous cases and transformation rules, the output for the last input grid should be:

[6]

Here's my reasoning:

1. The numbers in the grid are not uniformly distributed; they form patterns that can be observed by grouping them based on their adjacency. For example, there are groups of 3 and 7 that appear multiple times in the grid. 
2. The transformation rule mentions that objects persist despite noise or occlusion. In this case, the numbers don't seem to be significantly obscured by other numbers, so we can consider them as individual objects.
3. There are no tasks involving counting or sorting objects in this specific grid, so we don't need to apply basic arithmetic operations or compare sizes and shapes of objects.
4. The main interaction between objects seems to be the presence of the number 7, which is surrounded by 3s. This could indicate a transformation rule where the surrounding numbers influence the central number. However, in this case, it doesn't seem like there's any specific transformation occurring between the 3s and the 7s.
5. Based on these observations, we can conclude that the output should be the largest number present in the grid, which is 7.
