Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent numbers:
- Object A: [6, 3, 6] (connected by 6)
- Object B: [8, 8, 6] (connected by 8)

2. Apply transformation rules:
- Object A is not affected by the presence of noise or occlusion since it's a single object with no interaction with other objects. So, we keep it as it is.
- Object B has two instances of the number 8, which are part of the same object. We can merge these instances into a single instance to represent the object persistently. In this case, we can replace one of the 8s with a new number (e.g., 9) to differentiate it from the other instances of the number 8 in the grid.

3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic:
- We have two instances of Object B ([8, 8, 6] and [8, 8, 6]). Since they are the same object with the same numbers, we can count them as one occurrence. So, there is only one instance of Object B in the grid.

4. Apply elementary geometry and topology concepts:
- There are no specific geometric or topological transformations needed for this case since the objects are not interacting with each other or undergoing significant changes in shape or size.

5. Check whether the transformation works on previous input-output pairs:
- The transformation does not affect the previous cases, as they don't involve the specific pattern found in Case 3 (two instances of the same object with a number repeated).

Based on the reasoning above, here is the output grid for the last input:

  [8, 9, 6]
  [6, 3, 6]
  [6, 8, 8]
