Based on the provided transformation rules and previous cases, it is not possible to determine a unique output for the given input. The transformation rule is not clear enough to infer a specific pattern or rule that can be applied to generate an output grid. 

However, I can provide an example of one possible transformation that might satisfy some of the conditions:

Input:
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  [5, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

However, it is essential to note that this example may not be the correct or intended output for the given input.
