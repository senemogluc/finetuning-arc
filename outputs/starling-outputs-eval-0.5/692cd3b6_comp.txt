Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ...
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   
   Output:
   [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ...
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ...
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ...
   
   Output:
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ...
   [5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   
3. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ...
   [0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ...
   
   Output:
   [0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ...
   [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
   ...
   
In this case, the transformation rule is to merge adjacent objects with the same color and count the number of occurrences. The output grid will have a larger size than the input grid due to merging and counting.
