Here are my thoughts for each case:

Case 0: The objects in this grid seem to be arranged in a way that they are connected horizontally. The transformation rule could be based on counting and sorting objects. The output grid has a larger size than the input grid, with zeros filling up the empty spaces.

Case 1: This grid also shows connected objects horizontally. However, there's an additional vertical connection between the second and third rows in the first column. Again, counting and sorting seem to be guiding the transformation rule. The output grid is larger than the input grid.

Case 2: In this case, we have a grid with connected objects horizontally. There are also some vertical connections between adjacent columns. Counting and sorting appear to guide the transformation rule. The output grid has the same size as the input grid but has zeros filling up the empty spaces.

Case 3: This grid shows connected objects both horizontally and vertically. It seems like counting and sorting are guiding the transformation rule, with the output grid having a larger size than the input grid.

Case 4: In this case, we have a grid with connected objects horizontally. The transformation rule appears to be based on counting and sorting, as well as preserving the relationships between objects. However, the output grid is not provided for this case.

Based on the analysis above, I cannot provide an output grid for Case 4 since it's missing. Here are the outputs for Cases 0-3:

Case 0 Output:
  [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 6, 1, 8, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 9, 6, 4, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7]

Case 2 Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 4]
  [4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Case 3 Output:
  [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 9, 4, 2, 9, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 4, 0, 0, 0]
