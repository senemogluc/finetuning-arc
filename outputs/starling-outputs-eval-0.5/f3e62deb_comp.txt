Here's the reasoning for each case:

Case 1:
The transformation rule involves moving the 8s in a clockwise manner. The 8 at the top-right corner moves to the bottom-left corner, and the 8 at the bottom-right corner moves to the top-left corner.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

Case 2:
The transformation rule involves moving the 8s in a clockwise manner. The 8 at the top-right corner moves to the bottom-left corner, and the 8 at the bottom-right corner moves to the top-left corner.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 3:
The transformation rule involves moving the 6s in a clockwise manner. The 6 at the top-right corner moves to the bottom-left corner, and the 6 at the bottom-right corner moves to the top-left corner.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Case 4:
The transformation rule involves moving the 6s in a clockwise manner. The 6 at the top-right corner moves to the bottom-left corner, and the 6 at the bottom-right corner moves to the top-left corner.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 5:
The transformation rule involves moving the 8s in a clockwise manner. The 8 at the top-right corner moves to the bottom-left corner, and the 8 at the bottom-right corner moves to the top-left corner.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 6:
The transformation rule involves moving the 4s in a clockwise manner. The 4 at the top-right corner moves to the bottom-left corner, and the 4 at the bottom-right corner moves to the top-left corner.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
