Here's the output grid for the last given input:

  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Reasoning:
- The input grid consists of several connected regions with the value 8.
- The transformation rule involves persisting and transforming objects while maintaining their adjacency.
- In this case, the 8s are part of a single connected region that spans across multiple rows and columns.
- To maintain the adjacency of the 8s, we can copy the entire region to create the output grid.
- The background (value 0) is also copied to maintain its adjacency with the 8s.
