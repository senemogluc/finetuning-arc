Based on the provided input and previous cases, it seems that the transformation rule involves moving objects with a value of 1 or 8 to the left or right, depending on their position relative to other objects. Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Move all 1s to the right if they are surrounded by 0s and 8s.
2. Move all 8s to the left if they are surrounded by 0s and 1s.
3. If a 1 or 8 is at an edge of the grid, it will stay in place.
4. If a 1 or 8 is adjacent to another 1 or 8, they will swap positions.
5. If a 1 or 8 is surrounded by other 1s or 8s, it will stay in place.

Now, let's apply these rules to the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Applying the rules:

Output:
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]
