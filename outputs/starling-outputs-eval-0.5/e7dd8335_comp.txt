Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output:

1. Identify objects in the input grid:
   - Object A: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (top row)
   - Object B: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (4th row)
   - Object C: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] (5th row)
   - Object D: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (bottom row)

2. Apply the transformation rule:
   - Object A stays the same as it doesn't have any adjacent objects with the same color value.
   - Object B has two instances of itself horizontally and one instance vertically adjacent. We can merge these instances together by adding their counts: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. So, we get a new object with the count 8 instead of 3.
   - Object C stays the same as it doesn't have any adjacent objects with the same color value.
   - Object D stays the same as it doesn't have any adjacent objects with the same color value.

3. Combine the transformed objects into the output grid:
   - Output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (top row)
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] (4th row)
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] (5th row)
     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (6th row)
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (bottom row)

So, the output of the last input is:
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
