To determine the transformation rule, we should analyze the patterns and relationships between the objects in each case. It's important to note that the objects with the same number are part of the same object, and they persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. 

In Case 1:
- The objects with number 2 form a horizontal line, and the objects with number 3 form another horizontal line.
- The objects with number 0 surround these two lines.

In Case 2:
- The objects with number 8 form a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right.
- The objects with number 3 form a horizontal line, and the objects with number 0 are surrounding them.

In Case 3:
- The objects with number 7 form a square shape, while the objects with number 1 form another square shape inside it.
- The objects with number 0 surround these two squares.

In Case 4:
- The objects with number 5 and 6 form a rectangular shape.
- The objects with number 0 surround this rectangle.

Based on the analysis, we can infer the following transformation rule:

1. Identify and separate the objects with the same number from each other.
2. Recognize and maintain the geometric patterns formed by these objects (e.g., lines, squares, rectangles).
3. Ensure that the background (objects with number 0) surrounds or fills in any gaps between the geometric patterns.
4. Retain the original size of each object, and do not change its shape or position relative to other objects.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, there are no objects with number 8 or 3 to form any geometric patterns. Therefore, the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid.
