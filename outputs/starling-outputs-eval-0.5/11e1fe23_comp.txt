Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The pattern in the input grid does not seem to follow any clear rules or relationships that can be used to infer a transformation. 

One possible approach could be to consider each number as an individual object and try to move them around based on their positions, but without more context or information about the goal or intention behind these patterns, it's challenging to determine a valid transformation rule.
