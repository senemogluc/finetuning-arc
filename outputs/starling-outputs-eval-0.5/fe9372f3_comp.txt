Here's a possible transformation rule based on the provided cases:

1. Identify and separate objects by their color (value). In this case, we have only one object with values 2, 8, and 4. The background is value 0.
2. For each identified object, perform a rotation to align the object's maximum extent along the diagonal.
3. Combine rotated objects in the same position as the original input grid.

Applying this rule to the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ... (repeating pattern) ...

Output:
  [1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ... (repeating pattern) ...

Here's the reasoning for this transformation rule:

- The input grid has a repeating pattern of objects with values 2, 8, and 4.
- By rotating each object along its diagonal, we can align them in a more compact form while preserving their original shape and position.
- Combining the rotated objects back into the same positions as the original input grid results in the output grid.
