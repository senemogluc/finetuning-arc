To determine the transformation rule, we can analyze the previous cases and identify patterns. In all three cases, the same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object. The objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. Tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation or rebounding, are not present in these cases.

In Case 1 and Case 3, there is a pattern where the central group of 5's is surrounded by 2's. This pattern appears to be consistent across all cases. In each case, the central group of 5's is transformed into 5, 2, 5, followed by another 5 and then another 2. The outer 0's remain unchanged.

Considering these observations, we can deduce a transformation rule for the last input:

1. Identify the central group of 5's surrounded by 2's.
2. Transform the central group of 5's into 5, 2, 5, followed by another 5 and then another 2.
3. Keep all other 0's unchanged.

Applying this rule to the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
