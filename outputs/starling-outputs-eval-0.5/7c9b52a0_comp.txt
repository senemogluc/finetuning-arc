To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given cases and their corresponding outputs.

Case 0:
The transformation seems to be moving objects around based on their values. For example, all 1's are moved to the top-left corner of the output grid, while the 2's and 3's remain in the middle of the input grid. The pattern can be observed by examining the relative positions of the numbers before and after the transformation.

Case 1:
The transformation seems to involve creating a new object by combining adjacent objects with the same value (e.g., 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8). The resulting object is then placed in the output grid based on the relative positions of the original objects.

Case 2:
The transformation seems to involve creating a new object by combining adjacent objects with the same value (e.g., 9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0). The resulting object is then placed in the output grid based on the relative positions of the original objects.

Case 3:
The transformation seems to involve moving objects around based on their values and creating new objects by combining adjacent objects with the same value (e.g., 1, 0, 2, 0, 1). The resulting objects are placed in the output grid based on the relative positions of the original objects.

Based on these observations, we can induce a transformation rule for the last input:

1. Move objects around based on their values, similar to Case 0.
2. Create new objects by combining adjacent objects with the same value and place them in the output grid based on the relative positions of the original objects, similar to Cases 1 and 2.
3. If possible, merge objects that have a common boundary with a neighboring object having the same value (e.g., 1 and 0).
4. Ensure that the resulting grid has the same size as the input grid or smaller, but not larger.

Using this transformation rule, we can generate the output grid for the last input:

Output:
  [1]
  [0, 2, 3]
  [0, 4, 5]
  [0, 6, 7]
  [0, 8, 9]
