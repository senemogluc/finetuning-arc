I apologize for not providing the output earlier. Here's the output for the last input grid (Case 3):

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 0, 4]
[0, 2, 8, 0, 4]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the transformation rule is based on recognizing and leveraging elementary geometry and topology concepts. The grid is simplified by identifying and preserving the relationships between objects with the same number that are adjacent to each other.
