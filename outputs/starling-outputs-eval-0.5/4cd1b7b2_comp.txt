Here's my reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the objects by their numbers in the input grid. In this case, we have four distinct objects with numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3.
2. Determine the relationships between these objects. The objects are adjacent to each other in a clockwise manner, forming a circle.
3. Apply the transformation rule: Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object. In this case, we can rotate the grid by 90 degrees clockwise without losing any information about the relationships between the objects.
4. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs. It does not affect the previous cases, as they all have different patterns and relationships between the objects.
5. Output the transformed grid:
```less
[0, 3, 1, 2]
[3, 1, 4, 0]
[2, 4, 0, 3]
[1, 0, 3, 1]
```

The output of the last input is:
```
[0, 3, 1, 2]
[3, 1, 4, 0]
[2, 4, 0, 3]
[1, 0, 3, 1]
```
