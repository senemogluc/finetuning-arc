Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning for each case and the final output grid.

Case 1:
- The input grid has a single connected component with two adjacent objects (2, 2) in the middle. We can consider this as a single object, so we can merge these two objects into one (4, 4). We can also apply the "counting" rule by adding an extra 1 to the merged object. The output grid will have this merged object at the same position with the added value of 1.
- The surrounding objects are not affected as they are not adjacent to the merged object.

Output:
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:

We can also apply the "counting" rule by adding an extra 1 to the merged object. The output grid will have this merged object at the same position with the added value of 1.
- The surrounding objects are not affected as they are not adjacent to the merged object.

Output:
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

These are the final output grids for each of the cases.
