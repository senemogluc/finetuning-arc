Based on the prior that objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects, and recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects, we can infer the following transformation rule for this case:

1. Identify and merge adjacent objects with the same value (4 in this case) into a single object.
2. Treat the background (0) as a separate object.
3. Count the occurrences of each merged object and assign them to new positions in the output grid.

Applying these rules to the last input, we get:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
