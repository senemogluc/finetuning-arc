Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify adjacent objects with the same number to form a group.
In this case, we have the following groups:
   - Group 1: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]
   - Group 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. Transform the grid by moving each group to the top-left corner of the grid and removing duplicates within each group. Since all elements in Group 1 are unique, no transformation is needed.

3. Pad the grid with zeros to make it square if its height is not equal to its width. In this case, the grid is already square, so no padding is necessary.

4. Output the transformed grid:
   [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid for the last input is:
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
