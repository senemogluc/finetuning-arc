Here are my reasoning steps for each case:

Case 0:
- The first row consists of objects with color 2 and 3. By applying the transformation rule, we can see that all these objects merge into a single object with color 3. The same happens in the second and third rows. In the last three rows, there are no interactions between objects, so they remain unchanged.
- Transformed grid: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Case 1:
- In this case, we can notice that the first and second rows have objects with color 2 and 3 interacting. By applying the transformation rule, these objects merge into a single object with color 3. The same happens in the last three rows.
- Transformed grid: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Case 2:
- In this case, we can notice that the first and second rows have objects with color 2 and 3 interacting. By applying the transformation rule, these objects merge into a single object with color 3. The same happens in the third row. In the last three rows, there are no interactions between objects, so they remain unchanged.
- Transformed grid: [3, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 0, 3]

Case 3:
- In this case, we can notice that the first and second rows have objects with color 2 and 3 interacting. By applying the transformation rule, these objects merge into a single object with color 3. The same happens in the third row. In the last three rows, there are no interactions between objects, so they remain unchanged.
- Transformed grid: [3, 3, 3, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3]

Case 4:
- In this case, we can notice that the first and second rows have objects with color 2 and 3 interacting. By applying the transformation rule, these objects merge into a single object with color 3. The same happens in the third row. In the last three rows, there are no interactions between objects, so they remain unchanged.
- Transformed grid: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

Based on the reasoning above, the output for the last input (Case 4) is:

[3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
