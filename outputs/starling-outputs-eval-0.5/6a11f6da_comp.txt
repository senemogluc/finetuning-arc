Here are my reasoning steps for each case:

Case 0:
- The transformation rule is to recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects and translate or rebounding.
- We can see that the 1s, 6s, and 8s are part of different objects that interact with each other.
- By following the transformation rule, we can create the output grid by translating and rotating the objects to form a new configuration while preserving their relationships.

Case 1:
- The transformation rule is to recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects and translate or rebounding.
- We can see that the 1s, 6s, and 8s are part of different objects that interact with each other.
- By following the transformation rule, we can create the output grid by translating and rotating the objects to form a new configuration while preserving their relationships.

Case 2:
- The transformation rule is to recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects and translate or rebounding.
- We can see that the 1s, 6s, and 8s are part of different objects that interact with each other.
- By following the transformation rule, we can create the output grid by translating and rotating the objects to form a new configuration while preserving their relationships.

Case 3:
- The transformation rule is to recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects and translate or rebounding.
- We can see that the 6s are part of different objects that interact with each other.
- By following the transformation rule, we can create the output grid by translating and rotating the objects to form a new configuration while preserving their relationships.

Case 4:
- The transformation rule is to recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects and translate or rebounding.
- We can see that the 6s are part of different objects that interact with each other.
- By following the transformation rule, we can create the output grid by translating and rotating the objects to form a new configuration while preserving their relationships.

Case 5:
- The transformation rule is to recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects and translate or rebounding.
- We can see that the 1s, 6s, and 8s are part of different objects that interact with each other.
- By following the transformation rule, we can create the output grid by translating and rotating the objects to form a new configuration while preserving their relationships.

After analyzing all cases, it's clear that the last input case is Case 5. Here's the output grid for the last input:

  [1, 6, 8, 0, 6]
  [6, 1, 6, 8, 1]
  [6, 1, 0, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 1, 6]
  [1, 6, 6, 6, 6]
