Case 7:

Input:
  [7, 1, 7]
  [3, 3, 6]
  [8, 8, 6]

To generate the output grid for this input, we can apply the following steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, there are three main objects - the group of 7s, the group of 3s, and the group of 6s. The 8s form a separate object that is not directly interacting with any other objects.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Count the number of occurrences for each object in the input grid. There are two occurrences of the 7s, one occurrence of the 3s, and one occurrence of the 6s.
3. Transform the objects based on their relationships and interactions: Since there is no direct interaction between the objects, we can simply duplicate each object to create a new grid with more instances of the same objects. However, since the 8s are not part of any interacting group, they will remain in their original positions.
4. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: As this is the last input, we cannot verify it with previous pairs. But based on the transformation rules and reasoning, this should be a valid output for this case.

Output:
  [7, 7, 7]
  [3, 3, 6]
  [8, 8, 8]
  [3, 3, 6]
  [7, 7, 7]
  [3, 3, 6]
  [8, 8, 8]
