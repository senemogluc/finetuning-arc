Based on the provided transformations and priors, it's not possible to determine a unique output for the last input. The transformation rules are somewhat ambiguous, and multiple interpretations can be made depending on the context or goal. Here are two possible outputs based on different interpretations of the priors:

Output 1:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output 2:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

It's important to note that the transformation rules provided are not clear enough to determine a unique output for the last input.
