Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify adjacent numbers with the same value (e.g., [8, 0, 8]). Recognize that these form a single object. In this case, we have multiple such objects in the input grid.
2. Consider the transformation rules applied to each object:
   - Objects may be rotated or translated while maintaining their shape and size. For example, [8, 0, 8] can be transformed into [8, 8, 0].
   - Counting and basic arithmetic are used to recognize patterns and relationships between objects (e.g., finding the average of adjacent numbers). However, this step doesn't seem necessary for this specific input.
3. Apply the transformation rules to each object in the grid while maintaining their persistence:
   - For example, [8, 0, 8] becomes [8, 8, 0].
4. Ensure that the output grid is consistent with the transformation rules applied and maintains the same size as the input grid.
5. The final output grid for the last input is:

  [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]
