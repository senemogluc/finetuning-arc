Based on the transformation rules induced from the previous cases, we can analyze the given input and determine the output grid. Here's the step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 3:
In this case, we have two groups of objects (5, 5, 5) separated by a background (0). The transformation rule suggests that these groups persist despite noise or occlusion. Thus, we can transform the input grid as follows:

1. Identify the objects and their relationships: There are two groups of 5's separated by a background (0).
2. Apply the transformation rule: The objects persist in the transformed grid with no significant changes.
3. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: Yes, it does.

Output for Case 3:
  [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]
  [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]
  [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]

In summary, the output grid for the last input is:

  [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]
  [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]
  [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]
