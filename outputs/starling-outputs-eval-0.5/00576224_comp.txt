Case 3:
Input:
  [5, 1]
  [8, 9]

To generate the output grid for this case, we can follow the same approach as in previous cases. We will create a 6x2 grid to accommodate the transformation and ensure that adjacent numbers with the same value are part of the same object.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: We have two objects, one with the number 5 and another with the number 8. The number 9 is not part of any object as it is adjacent to a different object (number 1).
2. Apply counting or sorting tasks: There are no specific counting or sorting tasks in this case.
3. Recognize physical contact between objects: There is no direct physical contact between the two objects, but they are adjacent to each other.
4. Transform and persist objects: We can create a 6x2 grid and copy the input grid into the output grid without any transformation. The number 9 will be ignored as it doesn't belong to any object.
5. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation works for all previous cases, as the output grids were generated by simply replicating the input grid horizontally.

Output grid:
  [5, 1]
  [8, 9]
  [5, 1]
  [8, 9]
  [5, 1]
  [8, 9]
