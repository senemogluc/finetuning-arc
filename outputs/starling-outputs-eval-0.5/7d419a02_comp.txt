Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation rules applied to the input grid and their reasoning:

1. The grid has a large background value of 0 throughout, which can be safely ignored as it doesn't affect the object relationships or persistence.
2. Recognize that the objects in the grid are made up of 8s adjacent to each other. This suggests that the transformation rule should preserve these groups of 8s.
3. The objects are also persistent, as they maintain their positions and shapes even when surrounded by other 8s or 0s.
4. Counting or sorting objects is not a strong aspect of this grid, so we can ignore the numerical values associated with the 8s.
5. Physical contact between objects is observed in some cases (e.g., Case 2), which suggests that during the transformation process, objects may collide, rebound, slide, or otherwise interact with each other.
6. The grid's size remains constant throughout all input-output pairs, indicating that no new objects are created or destroyed during the transformation process.
7. Based on these observations, we can infer that the main transformation rule is to preserve groups of 8s as objects and maintain their relative positions, while allowing for physical contact between them.
8. The specific transformations in each case might involve translating, rotating, or scaling the objects, but the exact details are not explicitly stated.
9. The output grid size may vary depending on the input grid size, as long as the transformation rule is applied consistently.
10. In some cases (e.g., Case 2), the output grid might have fewer objects than the input grid due to object interactions or transformations resulting in the merging of adjacent 8s.

Based on these inferences and reasoning, the output grid for the last input would involve preserving the groups of 8s as objects while applying various transformations such as translation, rotation, or scaling. The specific details of the transformation are not provided, but the main objective is to maintain the object relationships and persistence while allowing for interactions between them.
