Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the output grid will have a similar structure as the input grid, but with some transformed objects. Here's an attempt to find the output grid based on the input grid provided in Case 3:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0]
  [5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0]
  [9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is based on the assumption that the transformation rule involves preserving the structure of the input grid while transforming some objects. However, it's important to note that this might not be the correct output for the given input grid, as there could be multiple valid interpretations of the transformation rules.
