Based on the given priors and previous cases, it seems that the transformation rule aims to reduce the grid size by selecting only the specific number patterns present in the input. In this case, the pattern of interest appears to be two 2's adjacent to a 4.

Here are the steps for the transformation:

1. Identify the pattern of interest (two 2's adjacent to a 4).
2. Remove all other numbers from the grid.
3. Create an output grid with only the identified pattern.

Following these steps, the output grid for the last input would be:

Output:
[2, 2]
[2, 2]
