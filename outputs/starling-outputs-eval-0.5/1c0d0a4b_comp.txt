To generate the output grid for the last given input grid using the transformation rule induced from previous input-output pairs, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify adjacent numbers with the same value and group them together as part of the same object.
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation or rebounding.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
5. Check whether the transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs.
6. The output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.

Now, let's analyze the last given input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

After analyzing the input grid and applying the transformation rule, we get the following output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rule and works on the previous input-output pairs.
