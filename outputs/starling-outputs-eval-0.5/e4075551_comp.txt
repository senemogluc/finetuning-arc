Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Look for adjacent same numbers and group them together as objects. Count the number of occurrences of each object in the grid.
2. Identify any objects that are reoccurring or have a distinct shape, size, or location compared to other objects.
3. Apply counting or basic arithmetic rules if there's a specific goal or intention associated with the transformation.
4. Use elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined in the priors.
5. Check whether the transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs to ensure consistency.

Based on these steps, here's the reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
- Objects are formed by same numbers that are adjacent (8, 4, and 2).
- The grid is relatively simple with no specific goal or intention.
- Transformations are applied based on geometric relationships between objects. For example, the 8's form a square shape in the center of the grid, which is preserved in the output.
- The transformation works consistently for previous input-output pairs.

Case 1:
- Objects are formed by same numbers that are adjacent (0, 4, 6, and 7).
- The grid has a specific goal or intention to create a checkerboard pattern with alternating 4's and 5's.
- Transformations are applied based on this goal, preserving the checkerboard pattern in the output.
- The transformation works consistently for previous input-output pairs.

Case 2:
- Objects are formed by same numbers that are adjacent (3, 4, and 5).
- The grid has a specific goal or intention to create a specific pattern with these objects.
- Transformations are applied based on this goal, preserving the pattern in the output.
- The transformation works consistently for previous input-output pairs.

Case 3:
- Objects are formed by same numbers that are adjacent (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).
- There is no specific goal or intention associated with the transformations in this grid.
- Transformations are applied based on geometric relationships between objects, but the resulting pattern is not consistent across previous input-output pairs.

Based on the reasoning above, the output for Case 3 is as follows:
