Based on the previous cases and the transformation rules induced from them, I will now generate the output grid for the last input grid.

Input:
  [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8]
  [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4]
  [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4]
  [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4]
  [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4]
  [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4]
  [2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5]
  [2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5]
  [2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5]
  [2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5]
  [2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5]
  [2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5]

Output:
  [8, 7, 9, 8]
  [3, 1, 6, 4]
  [2, 4, 1, 5]
