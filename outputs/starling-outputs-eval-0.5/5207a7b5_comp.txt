Based on the transformation rules induced from previous input-output pairs, we can generate the following output grid for the last input grid:

[8, 8, 8, 5, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify and group same-colored adjacent elements (5s) together as objects.
2. Transform these groups by applying the transformation rules. In this case, the 5s are transformed into 8s with a 6 added to their right side.
3. For the remaining background zeros, no transformation is applied.
4. The output grid now consists of the transformed objects and the unchanged background zeros.
