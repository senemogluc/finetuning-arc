Here's the reasoning for each case and the corresponding output grid:

Case 0:
- Prior 1: Adjacent objects have the same value.
- Prior 2: Objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.
- Prior 3: Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
- The grid consists of several 6's surrounded by 0's, forming a checkerboard pattern. There are no obvious translations, rebounds, or other interactions between the objects (numbers). So, we can focus on Prior 1 and Prior 2 to generate the output grid.
- We can see that each 6 is part of a larger object, which consists of 4 6's connected horizontally. There are also smaller objects consisting of 3 6's connected vertically. The largest object spans across all rows and columns, forming a checkerboard pattern.
- Based on these observations, we can create the following transformation rule: For every 3 adjacent 6's connected vertically, replace them with a single 8. For every 4 adjacent 6's connected horizontally, replace them with a single 4. The resulting grid will have fewer objects, but they will still persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.
- Following this transformation rule, we get the following output grid:

  [3, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 0]
  [8, 8, 8]

Case 1:
- The grid consists of several 3's and 1's connected in a checkerboard pattern. There are no obvious translations, rebounds, or other interactions between the objects (numbers). So, we can focus on Prior 1 and Prior 2 to generate the output grid.
- We can see that each 3 is part of a larger object, which consists of 4 3's connected horizontally. There are also smaller objects consisting of 3 1's connected vertically. The largest object spans across all rows and columns, forming a checkerboard pattern.
- Based on these observations, we can create the following transformation rule: For every 4 adjacent 3's connected horizontally, replace them with a single 2. For every 3 adjacent 1's connected vertically, replace them with a single 1. The resulting grid will have fewer objects, but they will still persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.
- Following this transformation rule, we get the following output grid:

  [2, 2, 0]
  [1, 1, 1]

Case 2:
- The grid consists of several 2's and 1's connected in a checkerboard pattern. There are no obvious translations, rebounds, or other interactions between the objects (numbers). So, we can focus on Prior 1 and Prior 2 to generate the output grid.
- We can see that each 2 is part of a larger object, which consists of 4 2's connected horizontally. There are also smaller objects consisting of 3 1's connected vertically. The largest object spans across all rows and columns, forming a checkerboard pattern.
- Based on these observations, we can create the following transformation rule: For every 4 adjacent 2's connected horizontally, replace them with a single 8. For every 3 adjacent 1's connected vertically, replace them with a single 1. The resulting grid will have fewer objects, but they will still persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.
- Following this transformation rule, we get the following output grid:

  [8, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]

Case 3:
- The grid consists of several 8's and 6's connected in a checkerboard pattern. There are no obvious translations, rebounds, or other interactions between the objects (numbers). So, we can focus on Prior 1 and Prior 2 to generate the output grid.
- We can see that each 8 is part of a larger object, which consists of 4 8's connected horizontally. There are also smaller objects consisting of 3 6's connected vertically. The largest object spans across all rows and columns, forming a checkerboard pattern.
- Based on these observations, we can create the following transformation rule: For every 4 adjacent 8's connected horizontally, replace them with a single 2. For every 3 adjacent 6's connected vertically, replace them with a single 6. The resulting grid will have fewer objects, but they will still persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.
- Following this transformation rule, we get the following output grid:

  [2, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 6, 6]
