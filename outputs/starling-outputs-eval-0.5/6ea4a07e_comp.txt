For the last input grid, we can use the following reasoning and transformation rule:

Input:
  [8, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 0]

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same numbers: There are three objects in this grid - one with the number 8 and two with the number 0 (background).
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: The object with the number 8 is touching all other objects, but it does not involve translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects: In this case, we have three instances of the number 8, so we need to divide them equally among the three positions where they are present.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: Since the objects with the number 8 are touching all other objects, we can distribute them evenly across the touched positions.
5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: We have three instances of the number 8, so we can place one instance in each of the three touched positions. This ensures that the transformation rule is applied consistently.
6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation works correctly for all previous cases as well.

Output:
  [2, 0, 2]
  [2, 0, 2]
  [0, 2, 0]
