Given the transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input without more context or specific guidelines. However, I can provide an example of how the output might look like based on the transformation rules provided earlier:

Output:
  [0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 0, 0]

This output assumes that the transformation rules prioritize persistence of objects and their transformations. The input grid has several instances of 2's connected horizontally or vertically, which are transformed into 8's in the output grid. The background (0) remains unchanged, and any other objects are assumed to be part of the same object as their adjacent 2's.
