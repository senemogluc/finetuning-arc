I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here's the correct output for the last input grid:

Case 4:
Input:
  [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7]
  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]

Output:
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
