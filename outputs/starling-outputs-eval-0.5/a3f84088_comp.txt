Here's the step-by-step reasoning for each transformation rule:

1. In the first case, we observe that there are two types of objects in the grid: groups of 5 and single 0s. The groups of 5 are adjacent to each other horizontally and vertically. We can merge these groups of 5 by replacing each group with a single 5. This results in the following output:

  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. In the second case, we have a grid with alternating 5 and 0 values. The 5s are adjacent to each other horizontally and vertically. We can merge these 5s by replacing each pair of adjacent 5s with a single 5. This results in the following output:

  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

3. In the third case, we have a grid with alternating 5 and 0 values. The 5s are adjacent to each other horizontally and vertically. We can merge these 5s by replacing each pair of adjacent 5s with a single 5. This results in the following output:

  [5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]

4. In the fourth case, we have a grid with alternating 5 and 0 values. The 5s are adjacent to each other horizontally and vertically. We can merge these 5s by replacing each pair of adjacent 5s with a single 5. This results in the following output:

  [1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]

5. In the fifth case, we have a grid with alternating 5 and 0 values. The 5s are adjacent to each other horizontally and vertically. We can merge these 5s by replacing each pair of adjacent 5s with a single 5. This results in the following output:

  [1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
