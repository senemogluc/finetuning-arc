Based on the provided priors and the previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The patterns in the input grid don't seem to follow any clear rules or relationships that can be leveraged to create an output grid using the given constraints.

However, if we assume that the main goal is to fill the grid with the number 4 as much as possible, we could attempt a transformation that tries to achieve this:

Output:
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 5, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 5]
  [5, 5, 0, 5]
  [5, 5, 5, 0]
  [5, 0, 5, 0]

Please note that this transformation is not based on a specific rule but rather an assumption of filling the grid with the number 4.
