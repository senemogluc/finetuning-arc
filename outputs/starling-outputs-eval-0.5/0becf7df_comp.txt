After analyzing the previous input-output pairs and the given priors, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation or rebounding. The output grid should have a similar structure to the input grid, but with transformed elements based on their adjacent values.

For the last input:
  [8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid is:

  [8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid satisfies the transformation rule and maintains a similar structure to the input grid.
