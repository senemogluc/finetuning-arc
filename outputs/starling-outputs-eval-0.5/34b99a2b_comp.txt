Based on the transformation rules provided and considering the previous cases, the output grid for the last input would be:

[2, 0, 2, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 0]
[0, 2, 0, 2]
[2, 2, 2, 2]
[2, 0, 2, 2]

Here's the reasoning for this output:

1. Identify and group objects based on their values (same numbers adjacent to each other). In this case, we have groups of 8, 4, and 5.
2. Observe that there is a consistent pattern of objects moving horizontally or vertically across the grid, with some rotation. For example, in the first row, the 8s move down one position and rotate 90 degrees clockwise, while the 4s move right one position and rotate 180 degrees. The 5s remain at their original positions but rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise.
3. Apply these transformations to the entire grid, keeping in mind that objects are assumed to persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. This results in the output grid shown above.
