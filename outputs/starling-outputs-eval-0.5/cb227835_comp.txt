Here's my reasoning and pick for the transformation rule:

1. The first case has a pattern where each number that's part of an object (group) is incremented by one, starting from 0 to 8, and then resetting back to 0 when reaching the edge of the grid. This pattern seems consistent across all cases.
2. The second case shows a similar pattern, but with a different starting point for the incrementing sequence (3 instead of 0). However, this pattern is only present in the first row and last column of the grid, which makes it less likely to be the main transformation rule.
3. The third case has a pattern where each object is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise, with some adjustments for objects that go beyond the grid's boundaries. This pattern seems consistent across all cases as well.
4. There doesn't seem to be any specific numerical pattern or transformation rule that affects the entire grid in all three cases. However, the rotation pattern is present in all of them.
5. Based on the consistency of the rotation pattern and its presence in all cases, I believe the main transformation rule is the 90-degree clockwise rotation of objects with some adjustments for objects that go beyond the grid's boundaries.
6. The numerical pattern in the first case might be a secondary transformation rule or an artifact of the input data.
7. Since the output grid should match the rotation rule, I will apply the 90-degree clockwise rotation to the last input grid, making sure to adjust for objects that go beyond the grid's boundaries:

Input:
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
