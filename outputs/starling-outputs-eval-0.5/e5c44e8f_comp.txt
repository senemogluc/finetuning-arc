Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify adjacent same-colored objects and group them together.
2. Transform the grid by moving the objects to a new position while maintaining their relative positions within the group.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic if necessary (e.g., adding or subtracting numbers).
4. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs.

For Case 3, the last input grid is:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

After identifying adjacent same-colored objects and grouping them together, we get:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, we can transform the grid by moving the objects to a new position while maintaining their relative positions within the group. In this case, we can simply shift the entire grid one step to the right:

  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs. Therefore, the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
