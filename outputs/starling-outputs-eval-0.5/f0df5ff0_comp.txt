In order to find the output grid for the last input, we need to apply the transformation rules inferred from previous cases. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the transformation rules and their application:

1. Transform adjacent elements that are part of the same object by moving them together as a single unit.
2. Objects persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. In many cases, objects from the input persist on the output grid, often in a transformed form.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one.
6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs.
7. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.

After analyzing the given input grid and applying the transformation rules, here's the output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 0, 6, 2, 7, 0, 1, 0, 2, 7, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8]
  [6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 6, 4]
  [0, 0, 4, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 7]
  [8, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 7]
  [3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 6, 8, 6, 7, 6, 1, 6, 6, 0, 4, 0, 7]
  [0, 8, 7, 0, 7, 8, 0, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4]
  [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 8, 4, 8]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 8, 3, 7, 6, 7, 8, 0, 8, 7]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3]
  [4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6]

This output grid is the result of applying the transformation rules inferred from previous cases to the last input grid.
