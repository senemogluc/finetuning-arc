Based on the previous cases and the transformation rules provided, it appears that the goal is to identify and separate objects with the same number. In this case, we can observe that there are no distinct objects in the input grid, as all numbers are spread out evenly across the grid without any adjacent instances of the same number.

Thus, the output grid should be an empty grid with no elements:

Output:
  []
  []
  []
  ... (repeated for the entire grid)
