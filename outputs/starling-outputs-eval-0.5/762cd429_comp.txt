Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case to find the transformation rule:

Case 0:
The grid has only zeros and one instance of non-zero value (2). There are no adjacent non-zero values, so the transformation rule is to keep the grid as it is.

Case 1:
1. The grid has two instances of non-zero values (3 and 5) that are adjacent horizontally. The transformation rule should merge these adjacent non-zero values into a single value (sum). In this case, 3 + 5 = 8.
2. The grid also has another instance of adjacent non-zero values (4 and 3) vertically. The transformation rule should merge these adjacent non-zero values into a single value (sum). In this case, 4 + 3 = 7.
3. All other zeros in the grid remain unchanged.

Case 2:
The grid has only zeros and one instance of non-zero value (1) that is surrounded by zeros. There are no adjacent non-zero values, so the transformation rule is to keep the grid as it is.

For all these cases, the output grids are the same as the input grids since there are no transformations needed based on the given priors and conditions.
