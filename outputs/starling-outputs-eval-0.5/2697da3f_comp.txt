Case 4:

To find the output for this case, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify and group the same numbers that are adjacent to each other. In this case, we have three groups of 4s and a background of 0s.
2. Determine the transformation rule based on the priors given. Since there is no specific information about counting or sorting, we can assume that the main goal is to maintain the persistence of objects despite noise or occlusion. In this case, the main interaction between objects is their translation and rebounding.
3. Apply the transformation rule by moving the groups of 4s around while maintaining their shape and size. Since there are no specific constraints on the movement, we can place them in any arrangement that satisfies the condition of persistence. Here's one possible output:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this output, the groups of 4s have been moved around while maintaining their shape and size. The background remains unchanged, as required by the persistence rule.
