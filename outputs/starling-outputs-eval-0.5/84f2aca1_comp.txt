Here's a step-by-step analysis of the transformation rule and reasoning for each option in each case:

Case 0:

1. Observe that there are two types of objects: 4s and 3s. The 4s form squares, while the 3s form triangles. There are no transformations happening to these objects, only translations or rearrangements.
2. Count the number of 4s and 3s in each row/column. For example, in the first row, there are 2 4s and 1 3. In the first column, there are 5 4s and 1 3. This pattern repeats throughout the grid.
3. Transform the grid by shifting the entire grid horizontally until all the 4s and 3s align in columns. In this case, we shift the grid 2 units to the left.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 3, 0, 0]
  [8, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:

1. Observe that there are two types of objects: 4s and 8s. The 4s form squares, while the 8s form rectangles. There are no transformations happening to these objects, only translations or rearrangements.
2. Count the number of 4s and 8s in each row/column. For example, in the first row, there are 1 4 and 3 8s. In the first column, there are 2 4s and 3 8s. This pattern repeats throughout the grid.
3. Transform the grid by shifting the entire grid horizontally until all the 4s and 8s align in columns. In this case, we shift the grid 1 unit to the left.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:

1. Observe that there are two types of objects: 4s and 3s. The 4s form squares, while the 3s form triangles. There are no transformations happening to these objects, only translations or rearrangements.

3. Transform the grid by shifting the entire grid horizontally until all the 4s and 3s align in columns. In this case, we shift the grid 1 unit to the left.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 7, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 3:

1. Observe that there are two types of objects: 4s and 3s. The 4s form squares, while the 3s form triangles. There are no transformations happening to these objects, only translations or rearrangements.

  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 4:

1. Observe that there are two types of objects: 3s and 2s. The 3s form triangles, while the 2s form rectangles. There are no transformations happening to these objects, only translations or rearrangements.
2. Count the number of 3s and 2s in each row/column. For example, in the first row, there are 1 3 and 1 2. In the first column, there are 3 3s and 1 2. This pattern repeats throughout the grid.
3. Transform the grid by shifting the entire grid horizontally until all the 3s and 2s align in columns. In this case, we shift the grid 1 unit to the left.

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
