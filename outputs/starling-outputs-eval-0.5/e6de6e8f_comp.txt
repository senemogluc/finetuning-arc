Here's the reasoning for each option and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid: The input grid has a pattern where numbers form rectangles with the same number on all sides. For example, the first rectangle is formed by 2-0-2-0-2, and another rectangle is formed by 2-2-2-0-2.
2. Apply transformation rule: Based on the priors, we can recognize that objects are assumed to persist despite noise or occlusion. The rectangles in the input grid are part of the same object, and their sides are connected. Therefore, we can transform the input grid by filling the interior of each rectangle with a 0 value, leaving only the outline of the rectangles.
3. Check if the transformation rule works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule has been applied consistently across all cases.
4. Output grid: Based on the reasoning and transformation rule, the output grid for the last input is as follows:

   [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid represents the transformation applied to the last input grid.
