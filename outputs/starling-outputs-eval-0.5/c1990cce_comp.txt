Case 3:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To generate the output grid for this input, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the numbers in the grid and their relationships.
2. Apply counting or basic arithmetic if necessary.
3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts.
4. Pay attention to object transformations and persistence.
5. Check whether the transformation works on previous input-output pairs.
6. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.

For this specific input, we have a single number 2 surrounded by zeros. Since there are no other numbers in the grid, there is no need to apply counting, basic arithmetic, or elementary geometry and topology concepts. The transformation rule is simple: keep the number 2 in the same position and surround it with zeros.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
