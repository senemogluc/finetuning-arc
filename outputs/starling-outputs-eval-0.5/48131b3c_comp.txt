To find the output grid for the given input grid, we can follow the transformation rules:

Input:
  [0, 1, 0, 1]
  [1, 0, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 1, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0]

From the input grid, we can identify the following objects:

Object 1: [0, 1, 0, 1] - This object is a rectangle with two 1s in it.
Object 2: [1, 0, 0, 1] - This object is a rectangle with one 1 in it.
Object 3: [0, 0, 1, 0] - This object is a rectangle with one 1 in it.
Object 4: [1, 0, 0, 0] - This object is a rectangle with no numbers in it.

Now, let's consider the relationships between these objects and their transformations:

1. Object 1 and Object 2 are connected horizontally. When they combine, we get a new object with two 1s in a row: [0, 1, 1, 0]
2. Object 3 is connected to Object 2 vertically. When they combine, we get a new object with one 1 in the middle: [1, 0, 1, 0]
3. Object 4 has no connections with other objects and can be considered as background (value 0).

Now, let's put these transformed objects together to form the output grid:

Output:
  [0, 1, 1, 0]
  [1, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]

So, the output grid for the given input is:

  [0, 1, 1, 0]
  [1, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
