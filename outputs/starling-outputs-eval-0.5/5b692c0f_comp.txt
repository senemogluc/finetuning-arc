Here's a breakdown of the transformation rules applied to the last input:

1. The first step is to identify objects that are adjacent to each other and have the same color (value). In this case, the 3x3 squares with the same value form separate objects. For example, the top-left corner object consists of the values [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0] and is surrounded by 2s.

2. Next, identify the objects that persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. In this case, the main object in the center of the grid with values [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] is surrounded by 3s and 2s.

3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements. Here, the main object in the center of the grid with values [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] has a physical interaction with the surrounding 3s and 2s, causing them to move or change.

4. Apply counting or basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. In this case, there are no specific numerical aspects to consider in the transformation rules.

5. Leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined earlier. Here, we can recognize that the main object in the center of the grid with values [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] is a rectangle shape, surrounded by other rectangles with different values, such as [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], and [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Based on these rules, the output grid should look like this:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's the output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0
