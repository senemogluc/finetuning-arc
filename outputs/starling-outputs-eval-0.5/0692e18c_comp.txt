Here's an explanation for each step of the transformation process.

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have three objects with the same color (3) adjacent to each other in a rectangular shape. There are no other objects or noise interfering with these objects.
2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects: Since there are no other objects present in the grid, we don't need to perform any counting or sorting operations. However, we can still arrange the objects in a more organized manner.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: As mentioned earlier, we don't need to apply counting or basic arithmetic in this case since there are no numerical aspects involved.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: The rectangular shape of the objects allows us to arrange them in a more organized manner by stacking them vertically.
5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: In this case, we can arrange the objects vertically, with the leftmost object at the bottom, followed by the middle object, and finally the rightmost object. This arrangement allows us to maintain the rectangular shape of the objects while also organizing them neatly.
6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule we induced from the previous cases is applicable here as well. The output grid maintains the same structure and relationships between the objects as in the input grid, while also presenting a more organized arrangement of the objects.

Based on these steps, the output grid for the last input (Case 3) would be:

  [0, 0, 3]
  [3, 3, 0]
  [3, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 0]
