Here are some observations about the transformations that can be applied to the given grid:

1. Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object. This suggests that we should consider merging adjacent numbers with the same value.
2. Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. This implies that we should try to preserve the structure of the grid as much as possible when applying transformations.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Look for patterns in the arrangement of numbers and sizes of objects.
4. Apply basic arithmetic and geometry concepts to find transformations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rotations, reflections, and translations.
5. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs. The output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.

Here's a possible output for the last input grid:

This output grid is a simplified version of the input grid, with all the numbers reduced to their respective positions in the sequence from 0-8.
