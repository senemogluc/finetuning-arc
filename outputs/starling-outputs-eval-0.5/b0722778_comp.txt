Based on the given priors and previous cases, I will generate the output grid for the last input grid. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. Identify objects with similar numbers adjacent to each other (persistence).
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects (translation, rebounding, or other interactions).
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for numerical aspects.
4. Leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts.
5. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs.

Last Input:
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4]
  [2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3]
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7]
  [8, 8, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0, 4, 4]

Output:
  [5, 1]
  [5, 1]
  [0, 0]
  [3, 2]
  [3, 2]
  [0, 0]
  [7, 8]
  [8, 4]

The output grid for the last input is:
  [5, 1]
  [5, 1]
  [0, 0]
  [3, 2]
  [3, 2]
  [0, 0]
  [7, 8]
  [8, 4]
