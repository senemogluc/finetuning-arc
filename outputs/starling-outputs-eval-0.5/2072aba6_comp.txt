Based on the transformation rules provided and the previous cases, let's analyze the last input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0]
  [5, 5, 5]

The grid consists of three objects: a row of zeros at the top and bottom, and a block of fives in the middle. There is no physical contact or interaction between these objects. We can infer that the transformation rule will separate these objects based on their spatial relationship.

Applying the transformation rule:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 2]
  [0, 2, 1]

In this output grid, we have separated the three objects based on their positions in the input grid. The row of zeros at the top and bottom remains intact, while the block of fives in the middle is transformed into a pattern of ones and twos.
