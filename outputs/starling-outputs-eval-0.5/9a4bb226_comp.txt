To find the correct transformation rule, let's analyze each case and identify patterns or rules that can be applied to transform the input grid into the output grid.

Case 0:
The input grid has a single large object with the number 9 at its center, surrounded by smaller objects with numbers 1-3. The transformation rule seems to be based on the position of these objects relative to the central object. The output grid only contains the outer edges of the larger object, which are the objects with numbers 1-3.

Case 1:
The input grid has a single large object with the number 9 at its center, surrounded by smaller objects with numbers 5 and 6. The transformation rule seems to be based on the position of these objects relative to the central object. The output grid only contains the outer edges of the larger object, which are the objects with numbers 5 and 6.

Case 2:
The input grid has a single large object with the number 9 at its center, surrounded by smaller objects with numbers 1-3. The transformation rule seems to be based on the position of these objects relative to the central object. However, this case is different from Case 0 because it only includes the top and bottom edges of the larger object.

Case 3:
The input grid has a single large object with the number 9 at its center, surrounded by smaller objects with numbers 1-3. The transformation rule seems to be based on the position of these objects relative to the central object. However, this case is different from previous cases because it only includes the left and right edges of the larger object.

Based on the analysis above, the transformation rule for each case is as follows:

1. Case 0: Remove all elements with a value less than or equal to 3, and keep only the outer edges of the remaining large object.
2. Case 1: Similar to Case 0, but remove all elements with a value less than or equal to 6 instead.
3. Case 2: Similar to Case 0, but keep only the top and bottom edges of the remaining large object.
4. Case 3: Similar to Case 0, but keep only the left and right edges of the remaining large object.

Now, let's apply these rules to the last input grid (Case 3) to find the output grid:

1. Remove all elements with a value less than or equal to 6. In this case, we are left with only the objects with numbers 7-9.
2. Keep only the left and right edges of the remaining large object. This means that we should only include the objects with numbers 9 in the output grid.

Output:

  [1, 3, 3]
  [1, 2, 2]
  [1, 3, 2]
