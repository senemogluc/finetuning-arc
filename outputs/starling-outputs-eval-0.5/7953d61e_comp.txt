Here's the output for the last input grid:

Case 5 Input:
[4, 6, 4, 4]
[4, 6, 4, 4]
[7, 6, 7, 9]
[9, 4, 9, 7]

Output:
[4, 6, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 6, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4]
[7, 6, 7, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[9, 4, 9, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[7, 6, 9, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[9, 4, 9, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1]

This output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and follows the given priors.
