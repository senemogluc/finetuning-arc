Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation rule for each case:

Case 0:
1. Identify objects and their relationships: The grid consists of two main objects, one with value 2 and another with value 1. They are adjacent to each other and share a common side.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Count the number of occurrences of each object in the grid. There are two instances of the object with value 2 and one instance of the object with value 1.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: In this case, there is no direct physical contact between the objects. However, we can observe that the object with value 1 is adjacent to the object with value 2 in a horizontal manner.
4. Apply transformation rule: Copy the object with value 2 and place it next to the existing one horizontally, resulting in a grid where each row has two instances of the object with value 2. The object with value 1 remains unchanged.
5. Output grid:
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:

Following the same steps as in Case 0, we have:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: The grid consists of two main objects, one with value 2 and another with value 1. They are adjacent to each other and share a common side.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Count the number of occurrences of each object in the grid. There are three instances of the object with value 2 and two instances of the object with value 1.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: In this case, there is no direct physical contact between the objects. However, we can observe that the object with value 1 is adjacent to the object with value 2 in a horizontal manner.
4. Apply transformation rule: Copy the object with value 2 and place it next to the existing one horizontally, resulting in a grid where each row has two instances of the object with value 2. The object with value 1 remains unchanged. However, since there are more instances of the object with value 2 than in Case 0, the grid will be larger.
5. Output grid:
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:

Following the same steps as in Case 0, we have:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: The grid consists of two main objects, one with value 2 and another with value 1. They are adjacent to each other and share a common side.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Count the number of occurrences of each object in the grid. There are three instances of the object with value 2 and one instance of the object with value 1.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: In this case, there is no direct physical contact between the objects. However, we can observe that the object with value 1 is adjacent to the object with value 2 in a vertical manner.
4. Apply transformation rule: Copy the object with value 2 and place it next to the existing one vertically, resulting in a grid where each row has two instances of the object with value 2. The object with value 1 remains unchanged. However, since there are more instances of the object with value 2 than in Case 0, the grid will be larger.
5. Output grid:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0,
