Based on the transformation rules provided and the previous cases, we can infer that the last input should result in the following output:

Output:
[2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2]
[5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5]
[5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4]

This output is a result of the transformation rules applied to the last input grid, considering object relationships, transformations, and persistence.
