Case 3:
Input:
  [0, 0, 9, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 9]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]

To generate the output grid for this input grid using the transformation rule induced from the previous cases, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify and group objects based on their adjacency in the input grid.
2. Apply transformations to maintain object persistence and account for physical contact between objects.
3. Use counting or sorting tasks to arrange the objects in the output grid, if necessary.
4. Ensure that the output grid is consistent with previous input-output pairs.

For this case, we can follow these steps:

1. There are two groups of objects in the input grid: {(0, 0), (0, 2)} and {(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 2)}. The first group has a single 9, while the second group has three 0s.
2. Since there's no physical contact between objects in the input grid, we can maintain their positions in the output grid. However, to better represent the groups of objects, we can place them side by side in the output grid.
3. In the output grid, we can place the first group of objects on the left and the second group of objects on the right. To accommodate the three 0s from the second group, we can add a row below the input grid to create an output grid with dimensions 6x5.
4. The output grid is consistent with previous cases in terms of maintaining object persistence and applying transformations based on adjacent objects.

Output:
  [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 9, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
