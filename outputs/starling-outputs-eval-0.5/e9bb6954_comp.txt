Here's an interpretation of the output for the last input case:

[0, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output represents a sequence of objects that are grouped together. The interpretation is as follows:

1. There are 8 groups of 9 elements each, with the first and last elements in each group being 7, 7, 8, 0, and 0.
2. Within each group, there's a pattern where the first and last elements are always 7 or 8.
3. The second element in each group is always 0.
4. Each group has 6 other elements that don't have any specific pattern.
5. There are 4 groups with an additional 0 at the end, and one group without it.
