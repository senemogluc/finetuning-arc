Based on the previous cases and the transformation rules provided, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the given input without more context or specific goals. The transformation rule relies on recognizing relationships between objects, their persistence, and transformations. However, the given input does not have clear connections between adjacent elements that would allow us to apply these rules consistently. 

Here's an example output based on a reasonable assumption of grouping similar values together:

Output:
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]
[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

However, please note that this output is only one possible interpretation of the input and may not be the intended result. More context or specific goals would be needed to provide a more accurate transformation rule-based output.
