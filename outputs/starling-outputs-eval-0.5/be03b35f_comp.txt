To find the transformation rule, let's analyze each case and identify common patterns or goals.

Case 0:
Goal: Merge objects with the same number (1) into a single object.
Transformation: Combine adjacent 1s horizontally.

Case 1:
Goal: Separate objects with different numbers (1 and 2).
Transformation: Split adjacent 1s vertically when encountering a 2.

Case 2:
Goal: Merge objects with the same number (0) into a single object.
Transformation: Combine adjacent 0s horizontally.

Case 3:
Goal: Separate objects with different numbers (1 and 2).
Transformation: Split adjacent 1s vertically when encountering a 2.

Based on the analysis, we can induce the following transformation rule:

1. Merge objects with the same number horizontally if possible.
2. If a different number is encountered while merging, split the current object and start a new one.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all objects are merged or split.

Now let's apply this rule to the last input:

Input:
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 0, 2, 2]
  [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]

Following the transformation rule:

1. Merge the first two 1s horizontally to create a single object with value 1.
2. Move on to the next row and merge the two 1s horizontally again. This creates an object with value 2.
3. Repeat this process for the rest of the grid, merging objects horizontally when possible. When encountering different numbers (0 or 2), split the current object and start a new one.
4. The final output is:

Output:
  [1]
  [1]
  [2]
  [2]
  [2]
