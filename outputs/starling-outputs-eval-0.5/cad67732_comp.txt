Here are the reasoning steps for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid based on the priors. In this case, we have several groups of numbers that form rectangular shapes. For example, [0, 0, 6, 6] forms a rectangle with the top-left corner at (2, 3), and [0, 4, 8, 6] forms another rectangle with the top-left corner at (1, 5).

2. Determine the transformations that need to be applied to each object. In this case, we can observe that all objects are rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise. We can see that [0, 6, 4] is a part of the same object as [0, 8, 6]. Similarly, [0, 0, 6, 6] and [0, 4, 8, 6] are parts of the same objects.

3. Apply the transformations to each object while maintaining their connections with other objects. This results in a new grid where all objects are rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise:

   Output:
   
   [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
   [0, 4, 8, 6, 0]
   [6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 8, 6, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
   [4, 8, 6, 0, 0]
   [6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 8, 6, 0, 0]

The final output grid is:

  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 8, 6, 0]
  [6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [4, 8, 6, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 6, 0, 0]
