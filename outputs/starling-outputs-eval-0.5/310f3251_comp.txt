Here's the reasoning behind each step and the final output for the last input grid:

1. Identify the same numbers that are adjacent to each other, and consider them as part of the same object. In this case, we have a 2x2 square with the number 0 in the top-left corner and another 2x2 square with the number 4 in the bottom-right corner.
2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we don't have explicit counting or sorting tasks, but we can count the number of distinct objects (in this case, two).
3. Apply basic arithmetic if needed for numerical aspects. We don't need to apply arithmetic in this case.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. In this case, we have two squares that are not connected.
5. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs. It does for all previous cases.
6. The output grid should be the same size or larger than the input grid. In this case, it's the same size as the input grid (2x2).

Based on these steps and reasoning, here's the output for the last input grid:

  [0, 0]
  [0, 4]
