Here's the reasoning for each case and the corresponding output grid.

Case 0:
The input grid consists of two separate objects with value 9 connected by a single row of value 0. The transformation rule suggests that objects persist despite noise or occlusion, so we can expect these two objects to remain connected but possibly transformed. Since there is no physical contact between the objects, they will not translate or rebound. Counting and basic arithmetic are not relevant in this case. Elementary geometry and topology concepts do not apply here either.

Output: As mentioned earlier, we expect the two 9-valued objects to remain connected but possibly transformed. One possible transformation is to have them form a square shape with a single row of value 0 at its center. Here's an example output grid that satisfies these conditions:

  [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9]
  [9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9]
  [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]
  [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9]
  [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9]

Case 1 to Case 4 follow a similar reasoning process as Case 0. Due to the limited space, I will not provide detailed explanations for each case. However, you can apply the same principles of object persistence and transformation based on the given priors to generate the output grids for these cases.

Case 5:
The input grid consists of two separate objects with value 6 connected by a single row of value 0. The transformation rule suggests that objects persist despite noise or occlusion, so we can expect these two objects to remain connected but possibly transformed. Since there is no physical contact between the objects, they will not translate or rebound. Counting and basic arithmetic are not relevant in this case. Elementary geometry and topology concepts do not apply here either.

A possible transformation for this grid is to have the two 6-valued objects form a square shape with a single row of value 0 at its center. Here's an example output grid that satisfies these conditions:

  [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]

So, the output of the last input (Case 5) is:

  [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]
