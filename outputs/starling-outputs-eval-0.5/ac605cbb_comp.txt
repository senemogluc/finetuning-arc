Based on the given transformation rules and previous input-output pairs, we can infer that the transformation rule in this case is to create a pattern with adjacent numbers that form a rectangle. The pattern starts from the top-left corner and moves downwards until it reaches the bottom of the grid or a non-zero number.

Here's an analysis of the last input:

1. Top-left corner has 0, so we can start creating the pattern there.
2. We have 1 adjacent to the top-left corner, and another 1 below it. So, we can create a rectangle with these two 1s. The pattern now looks like this:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
3. We have another 1 below the previous rectangle's bottom-right corner. So, we can add it to the pattern:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
4. There are no more non-zero numbers adjacent to the existing pattern, so we cannot create any more rectangles with this transformation rule.

Thus, the output of the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
