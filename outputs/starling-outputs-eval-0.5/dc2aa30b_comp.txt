Here's a step-by-step explanation for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule here seems to be that objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object. The objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects, and tasks involving physical contact between objects (translation, rebounding) are recognized.
