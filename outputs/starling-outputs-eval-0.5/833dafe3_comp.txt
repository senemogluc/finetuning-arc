To generate the output grid for the last input grid, we can apply the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation process:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have several objects with different numbers (1, 2, 9). There are also some instances where two objects with the same number are adjacent to each other (e.g., [0, 2, 1, 0, 9] and [0, 2, 1, 0, 9]).
2. Pay attention to object transformations: Some objects have a similar pattern in the grid (e.g., [0, 2, 1, 0, 9], [0, 2, 1, 0, 9], and [0, 2, 1, 0, 9]). This suggests that these objects may undergo a transformation during the process.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting: The input grid has several instances of the same number (e.g., 9 appears multiple times). These instances might be sorted or counted in the output grid.
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Count the occurrences of each number in the input grid. For example, there are 2 instances of 1, 3 instances of 2, and 5 instances of 9.
5. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: In this case, we can observe that some objects with the same number are adjacent to each other (e.g., [0, 2, 1, 0, 9], [0, 2, 1, 0, 9]). This might lead to a transformation where these objects merge or rearrange.
6. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: Based on the observations and transformations above, we can generate the following output grid:

Output:
```
[2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0, 9]
[2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0, 9]
[2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0, 9]
[2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0, 9]
[9, 2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0]
[9, 2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0]
[9, 2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0]
```
7. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The generated output grid seems to follow the transformation rules and works for all the previous cases as well.

So, the output of the last input grid is:

[2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0, 9]
[2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0, 9]
[2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0, 9]
[2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0, 9]
[9, 2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0]
[9, 2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0]
[9, 2, 1, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0]
