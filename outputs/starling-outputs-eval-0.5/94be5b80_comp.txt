Here's my reasoning for each option and the final output grid:

1. Observe the patterns in the input grids: In all three cases, there are several instances where a specific number (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3) appears in a block or rectangle shape. This suggests that these numbers might be part of an object and should be preserved during transformation.

2. Identify the objects and their relationships: In each case, we can identify a set of connected objects formed by the same number. For example, in Case 0, there are several horizontal lines of the same number (e.g., the 4s or the 6s). These horizontal lines appear to be part of the same object and should be preserved during transformation.

3. Analyze the transformations: The main transformation rule appears to involve moving objects horizontally while preserving their shape and structure. For example, in Case 0, the 4s and 6s are moved from one side of the grid to the other, maintaining their horizontal alignment. In Case 2, the pattern with the numbers 1, 3, and 8 seems to be shifted downwards by one row while preserving its shape and structure.

4. Apply the transformation rule: Based on the analysis in steps 2 and 3, we can apply the following transformation rules for each case:
   - Case 0: Move all objects horizontally, maintaining their alignment with adjacent objects. For example, move the horizontal lines of 4s and 6s from the left to the right side of the grid.
   - Case 1: No significant transformations are observed, so we can leave the output grid unchanged.
   - Case 2: Move the pattern with the numbers 1, 3, and 8 downwards by one row while preserving their alignment with adjacent objects.

Based on these rules, here are the output grids for each case:
