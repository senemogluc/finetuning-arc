Case 3:

To determine the transformation rule and generate the output grid for the last input, we need to consider the following observations:

1. Similar objects are adjacent to each other, as mentioned in the priors.

2. Objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. In many cases, objects from the input persist in a transformed form in the output grid.

3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.

4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects, comparing numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.

5. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.

6. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:

- Merge adjacent objects with the same value if they are connected horizontally or vertically. If an object is surrounded by other objects of the same value, it will be transformed into a single object with that value.

Following this rule, let's transform the input grid step by step:

1. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - no change
2. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - no change
3. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - no change
4. [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] - no change
5. [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] - no change
6. [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] - no change
7. [0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 0] - merge the 2s in the same row and column
8. [0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 0] - no change
9. [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] - no change
10. [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] - no change
11. [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] - no change
12. [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] - no change
13. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - no change

Based on the transformation rule and the observations made above, the output grid for the last input is:

Output:
  [2, 0]
  [0, 3]
