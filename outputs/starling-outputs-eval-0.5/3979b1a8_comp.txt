Based on the given priors and the previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, it seems like the objects are moving in a specific direction or pattern, and some objects might be occluded by others. 

Here's my reasoning for each step of the transformation:

1. Identify the main object that is moving horizontally through the grid (the 1s).
2. Follow the path of this main object, preserving its shape and direction as much as possible.
3. As the main object moves, it may collide with other objects or occlude them temporarily. In these cases, preserve the original positions of the collided/occluded objects in the output grid, but mark them as 0 (background).
4. When the main object moves back to its original position after a collision or occlusion, restore the original object at that location and continue following the path.
5. If any new objects are introduced during the transformation process, they should be added to the output grid in their correct positions relative to the main object's path.
6. Once the main object has completed its movement through the entire grid, merge all the preserved objects back into the output grid in their original locations.
7. If there are any remaining 0s (background) in the output grid after merging the objects, fill them with the lowest non-zero number present in the input or output grids.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the last input grid:

Input:
  [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]
  [1, 1, 9, 1, 1]
  [1, 9, 9, 9, 1]
  [1, 1, 9, 1, 1]
  [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 9, 9, 0]
  [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]
  [1, 1, 9, 1, 1]
  [1, 9, 9, 9, 1]
  [1, 1, 9, 1, 1]
  [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]

Here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 9, 9, 0]
  [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]
  [1, 1, 9, 1, 1]
  [1, 9, 9, 9, 1]
  [1, 1, 9, 1, 1]
  [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]
