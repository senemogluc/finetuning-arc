Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify same-colored adjacent objects and their transformations. In this case, there are two main colors, 5 and 6. They are adjacent to each other in several places. We can see that they form a rectangle shape with a hole in the center, where the 0's are located.
2. Count the number of occurrences of each color in the grid:
   - Color 5 occurs 19 times.
   - Color 6 occurs 17 times.
3. Recognize the transformation rule: The rectangle-shaped objects formed by colors 5 and 6 are transformed together, preserving their shape and size. The 0's inside the rectangle also move together with the surrounding object.
4. Apply the transformation rule to the grid:
   - Move the entire rectangle-shaped object formed by colors 5 and 6 to the top-left corner of the grid, while keeping the 0's inside the rectangle intact.
5. The output grid is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
