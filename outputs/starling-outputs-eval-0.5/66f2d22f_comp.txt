Based on the transformation rules and previous cases, I will generate the output grid for the last given input grid:

Input:
  [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2]
  [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]

Output:
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's the reasoning for the transformation:

1. Identify and group objects based on their values (3, 2, and 0).
2. Recognize that there are no tasks involving counting or sorting objects in this case.
3. Apply the transformation rule by moving and transforming objects while maintaining persistence and relationships.
4. The input grid has a rectangular shape with some noise. After applying the transformation rule, the output grid becomes more organized and less noisy.
5. Check if the transformation rule works on previous input-output pairs (it does).
