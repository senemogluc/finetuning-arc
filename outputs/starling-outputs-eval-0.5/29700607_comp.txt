Based on the provided transformations and reasoning, the output for the last input can be derived as follows:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the transformation rule is applied as follows:
- Combine adjacent objects with the same number (e.g., 4 and 8 become 12)
- Repeat the process until no more transformations can be applied
- Fill in missing values with zeros

The output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 12, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
