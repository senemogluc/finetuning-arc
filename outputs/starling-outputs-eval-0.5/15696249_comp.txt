Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to generate the output grid for the last input grid using the transformation rule induced from previous cases:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have three objects with different colors (6, 4, and 3). The 6's are in a row horizontally, while the 4's are adjacent to them vertically, and the 3's are also adjacent to the 4's.
2. Apply transformation rule: We don't have any specific tasks involving physical contact, counting, or sorting in this case. However, we can still apply some basic transformations based on the relationships between these objects.
3. Generate the output grid: We can rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise to create a new configuration with the same underlying structure. Then, we can apply the transformation rule induced from previous cases to this new configuration.
4. Check if the transformation works for previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule should work for all previous input-output pairs as well. In this case, it does not affect the output grids of previous cases significantly, but it helps us create a new configuration that can be further transformed using the same rules.

Here's the rotated input grid:
```less
[4, 4, 3]
[6, 6, 4]
[4, 4, 3]
```
And here's the output grid after applying the transformation rule induced from previous cases to this new configuration:
```less
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3]
[6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4]
[4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
So, the output grid for the last input is:
```less
[4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3]
[6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4]
[4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3]
```
