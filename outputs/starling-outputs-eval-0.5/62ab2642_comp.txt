Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their transformations:
   - The main object in the input grid is a rectangle formed by same-colored adjacent squares (5, 0). There are two instances of this rectangle with different orientations.
   - Objects with color 8 are created by the intersection of these rectangles and the background squares.
   
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic:
   - Count the number of occurrences of the main object (rectangle) in each row and column.
   - For the first rectangle, count 7 occurrences along the horizontal axis and 5 along the vertical axis. For the second rectangle, count 5 occurrences along the horizontal axis and 8 along the vertical axis.

3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts:
   - The main objects (rectangles) have a shape that can be described as a combination of squares and triangles.
   - The intersection points of these rectangles create new objects with color 8, which are also geometric shapes (squares or triangles).
   
4. Transform the input grid based on the identified rules:
   - For each main object (rectangle), replace it with a shape formed by 5 squares and 3 triangles, with color 8 for the new objects.
   - For intersection points of these rectangles, create new objects with color 8 using squares or triangles as needed.
   
Here's the output grid:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the output grid is smaller than the input grid.
