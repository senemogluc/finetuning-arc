Here's my reasoning for each option and the final output grid:

1. In the first case, we can see that the 2's and 3's are adjacent to each other in several locations. We can also observe that the 3's are connected horizontally and vertically, forming a square shape. The 4's and 8's appear to be part of the same object as well, with a similar horizontal and vertical connection pattern. Based on these observations, we can apply a transformation rule that merges adjacent 2's and 3's horizontally and vertically into a single object, while keeping the 4's and 8's separate.

Output:

2. In the second case, we can see that the 3's and the 7's are adjacent to each other in several locations. The 8's appear to be part of the same object as well, with a similar horizontal connection pattern. Based on these observations, we can apply a transformation rule that merges adjacent 3's and 7's horizontally and vertically into a single object, while keeping the 8's separate.
