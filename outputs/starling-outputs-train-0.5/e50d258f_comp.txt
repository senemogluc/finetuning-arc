Here are my reasoning steps and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on adjacent numbers with the same value. For example, object A consists of [8, 8, 8, 8], object B consists of [2, 8, 8, 8], etc.

2. Apply priors to recognize tasks and relationships between objects:
   - Persistence of objects despite noise or occlusion: Objects A, B, and C persist in the output grid.
   - Physical contact between objects: There are no significant interactions or translations between objects in this case.
   - Counting or sorting objects: No specific counting or sorting tasks can be identified from the input grid.

3. Apply elementary geometry and topology concepts to determine the transformation rule. In this case, we can see that object A is connected to object B at the bottom-right corner (8, 8). Similarly, object B is connected to object C at the bottom-left corner (1, 0). Based on these connections, it seems reasonable to assume that the output grid should maintain these connections while removing any noise or occlusions.

4. Apply the transformation rule to create the output grid:
   - Remove noise and occlusions: Objects A, B, and C are relatively clean, so no significant changes are needed.
   - Maintain connections between objects: Preserve the connection between object A and object B (8, 8), and between object B and object C (1, 0).

Based on these steps, the output grid for the last input is as follows:

  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [2, 8, 8, 8]
  [1, 8, 8, 8]
