Here's a step-by-step analysis and reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
- The grid has a single object in the center (2x2 block).
- There are also isolated objects at the edges with value 1.
- Transformation: Remove the central object, and place the isolated objects at the edges of the output grid.

Case 1:
- The grid has a single object consisting of two connected 2x3 blocks (top left and top right).
- There are also isolated objects at the bottom left and bottom right corners with value 1.
- Transformation: Remove the central part of the object, and place the isolated objects at the edges of the output grid.

Case 2:
- The grid has a single object consisting of two connected 3x2 blocks (left and right columns).
- There are also isolated objects at the top left and bottom right corners with value 1.
- Transformation: Remove the central part of the object, and place the isolated objects at the edges of the output grid.

Case 3:
- The grid has a single object consisting of two connected 2x3 blocks (top left and top right).
- There are also isolated objects at the bottom left and bottom right corners with value 1.
- Transformation: Remove the central part of the object, and place the isolated objects at the edges of the output grid.

Based on these cases and transformations, the output for the last input (Case 3) should be:

  [0, 0, 0, 1]
  [1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
