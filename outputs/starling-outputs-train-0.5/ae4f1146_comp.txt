Based on the given transformation rules and previous input-output pairs, we can infer that the goal here is to find the objects with the same numbers adjacent to each other and transform them accordingly. In this case, the main object in the grid is a 3x3 square of 8s surrounded by 1s.

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the main object (3x3 square of 8s) and its surrounding objects (1s).
2. Transform the main object by moving it to a new position in the grid while preserving its shape and size.
3. Ensure that the surrounding objects are also transformed accordingly, maintaining their relationships with the main object.
4. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs.

Given these steps, we can generate the output grid for the last input:

Output:
  [8, 1, 8]
  [8, 8, 1]
  [1, 8, 8]

This output satisfies the transformation rules and preserves the relationships between objects in the previous input-output pairs.
