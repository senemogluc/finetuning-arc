Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Analyze the input grids and identify patterns or repetitions. In this case, we can observe that there are 3x3 blocks with a specific pattern (e.g., [0, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0]). These blocks appear in the input grids and seem to represent objects.
2. Based on this observation, we can group these 3x3 blocks as single objects. For example, the first 3x3 block with pattern [0, 7, 0] becomes a single object, which we'll call Object A ([0, 7, 0]). Similarly, the second 3x3 block with pattern [7, 0, 4] becomes another object, which we'll call Object B ([7, 0, 4]).

Here's a summary of the identified objects and their positions in the input grid:

Object A ([0, 7, 0]) - Position: (0, 0), (3, 0), (6, 0)
Object B ([7, 0, 4]) - Position: (0, 3), (3, 3), (6, 3)

1. Now that we have identified the objects and their positions, we can create a new grid to represent the transformed objects. We'll place Object A at position (0, 0) and Object B at position (0, 3). The background will remain as 0.
2. In this step, we need to consider the transformations that might have occurred between the input grids. Based on the patterns in the input grids, it seems like these objects have undergone a translation or rebounding motion, but no rotation. Therefore, we can simply place the objects at their respective positions without any further transformation.
3. Since there are no other transformations or persistence rules to consider, our final output grid is:

Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
