Here's my reasoning for the last input grid:

1. The grid has a background (0) and several objects with values ranging from 1 to 5. There are no values above 5, so we can focus on these smaller numbers.
2. The objects are not connected horizontally or vertically, but they are adjacent in the diagonal direction. For example, 1s are diagonally adjacent to each other (top-left to bottom-right).
3. There is a pattern of alternating 0 and 1 values along the diagonal lines. We can consider this as a transformation rule that maintains the pattern while shifting the grid.
4. Since there are no other patterns or relationships between the objects, we can apply this transformation rule to maintain their relative positions.
5. After applying the transformation rule, we get the following output:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

This output grid maintains the original pattern and relationships between objects while applying the transformation rule.
