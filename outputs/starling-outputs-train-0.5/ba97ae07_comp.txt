To determine the transformation rule for each case, we can analyze the patterns and relationships between objects in the input grids. In all cases, adjacent numbers are part of the same object, and objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. Additionally, tasks involving counting or sorting objects can be observed in some cases.

For Case 3, we can see a pattern where there is a larger number (2) surrounded by smaller numbers (1). This suggests that the transformation rule should involve moving the larger object towards the center of the grid while maintaining its shape and size. Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the larger object (the one with 2s) and the surrounding smaller objects (the ones with 1s).
2. Move the larger object towards the center of the grid, maintaining its shape and size.
3. Fill in the empty spaces left by the larger object with the smaller objects.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all objects have been transformed.

Applying this transformation rule to Case 3, we get the following output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

For the last input grid (Case 4), we can follow a similar transformation rule:

1. Identify the larger object (the one with 4s) and the surrounding smaller objects (the ones with 3s).
2. Move the larger object towards the center of the grid, maintaining its shape and size.
3. Fill in the empty spaces left by the larger object with the smaller objects.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all objects have been transformed.

Applying this transformation rule to Case 4, we get the following output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
