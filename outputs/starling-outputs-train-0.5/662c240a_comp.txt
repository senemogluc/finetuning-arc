Here's a breakdown of the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

Case 0:
- The numbers in the grid are arranged in a way that forms a single object with a background (0). The main goal here seems to be counting or sorting objects based on their values.
- There are two types of objects in this grid, one with value 8 and another with values 9 and 2. These objects interact with each other, but no physical contact is observed.
- Transformation: We can count the occurrences of each number and create a new grid with only those numbers, ignoring the background (0).
  Input: [8, 9, 8], [9, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 3], [3, 3, 3]
  Output: [8, 9, 8], [9, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 3], [3, 3, 3]
  
Case 1:
- The numbers in the grid are arranged in a way that forms a single object with a background (0). The main goal here seems to be counting or sorting objects based on their values.
- There are two types of objects in this grid, one with value 5 and another with values 3 and 6. These objects interact with each other, but no physical contact is observed.
- Transformation: We can count the occurrences of each number and create a new grid with only those numbers, ignoring the background (0).
  Input: [1, 5, 5], [5, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1], [3, 3, 3], [3, 6, 3], [3, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 2], [7, 2, 2]
  Output: [5, 5, 5], [5, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1], [3, 3, 3], [3, 6, 3], [3, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 2], [7, 2, 2]
  
Case 2:
- The numbers in the grid are arranged in a way that forms a single object with a background (0). The main goal here seems to be counting or sorting objects based on their values.
- There are two types of objects in this grid, one with value 2 and another with values 3 and 8. These objects interact with each other, but no physical contact is observed.
- Transformation: We can count the occurrences of each number and create a new grid with only those numbers, ignoring the background (0).
  Input: [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 3], [5, 7, 7], [7, 5, 5], [7, 5, 5], [8, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1]
  Output: [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 3], [5, 7, 7], [7, 5, 5], [7, 5, 5], [8, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1]
  
Case 3:
- The numbers in the grid are arranged in a way that forms a single object with a background (0). The main goal here seems to be counting or sorting objects based on their values.
- There are two types of objects in this grid, one with value 4 and another with values 8 and 3. These objects interact with each other, but no physical contact is observed.
- Transformation: We can count the occurrences of each number and create a new grid with only those numbers, ignoring the background (0).
  Input: [8, 8, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 8], [1, 1, 3], [1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1]
  Output: [8, 8, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 8], [1, 1, 3], [1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1]
  
Case 4:
- The numbers in the grid are arranged in a way that forms a single object with a background (0). The main goal here seems to be counting or sorting objects based on their values.
- There are three types of objects in this grid, one with value 5, another with values 3 and 2, and a third with values 1 and 8. These objects interact with each other, but no physical contact is observed.
- Transformation: We can count the occurrences of each number and create a new grid with only those numbers, ignoring the background (0).
  Input: [5, 4, 4], [4, 5, 4], [4, 5, 4], [3, 3, 2], [3, 3, 2], [2, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 8], [1, 8, 8]
  Output: [5, 4, 4], [4, 5, 4], [4, 5, 4], [3, 3, 2], [3, 3, 2], [2, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 8], [1, 8, 8]

The output of the last input (Case 4) is:
  [5, 4, 4], [4, 5, 4], [4, 5, 4], [3, 3, 2], [3, 3, 2], [2, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 8], [1, 8, 8]
