Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify the same-colored adjacent objects in the input grid. In this case, we can see that there are 2x3 groups of the same color (8) and one group of 2s.
2. Treat these groups as single objects to simplify the problem. The grid now becomes:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
   [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
   [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]

3. Apply the transformation rule by moving the objects with the same number of steps to the right:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
   [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
   [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

4. Reconstruct the grid with the transformed objects:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

The output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
