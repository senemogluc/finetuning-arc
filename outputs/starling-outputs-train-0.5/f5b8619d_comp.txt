To generate the output grid for the last given input grid, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships based on adjacent numbers. In this case, we have four groups of objects: {3}, {0, 3}, {0}, and {0, 0}.
2. Transform the objects while maintaining persistence and considering physical contact between them. Here, we can rotate each object group by 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Apply counting or sorting tasks if necessary, but in this case, it's not needed.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined earlier. We can use rotation to achieve the transformation.
5. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs (it does).
6. The output grid should be larger than the input grid due to rotations.

After applying these steps, we get the following output grid:

[0, 0, 3, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 3]
[3, 0, 0, 0]
