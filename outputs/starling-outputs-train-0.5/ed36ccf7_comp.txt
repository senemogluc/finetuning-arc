To generate the output grid for the last given input using the transformation rule induced from the previous cases, we need to consider object relationships, transformations, and persistence. We also need to pay attention to tasks involving counting or sorting objects, compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects, and apply basic arithmetic if necessary.

Input:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5]

In this case, we have two objects with the number 5. The first object is a row of three zeros, and the second object is a single five at position (1,1). We can observe that the first object persists despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. However, there's no transformation or interaction between these two objects.

To create an output grid that corresponds to the input grid using the transformation rule, we can simply maintain the positions and values of the original objects without any significant changes:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5]

This output grid also works on the previous input-output pairs, as it maintains the positions and values of the original objects without any significant changes.
