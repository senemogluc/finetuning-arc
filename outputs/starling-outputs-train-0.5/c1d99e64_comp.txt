Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each transformation rule:

1. Identify and merge adjacent objects with the same color value (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...). If the merged object contains no 0s, replace all its 0 values with its own color value plus 1.
2. For each object, count the number of times it appears consecutively in the input grid. Add this count to the top-left corner of the object's bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing the entire object).
3. If an object is completely surrounded by a single color value (i.e., all its neighboring cells share the same color), merge it with that color if possible and safe. This can be done only if the merged object is still connected to at least one other object of the same color.
4. Transform objects by translating them horizontally or vertically by a single unit, while ensuring they are still connected to at least one other object of the same color. If this transformation results in an overlapping region with another object, merge the two objects if possible and safe. 
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until no more transformations can be applied or the desired output grid is reached.

For the last input grid:

1. Merge adjacent objects with the same color value. There are no merges in this step. The count of each object's appearance remains unchanged.
2. Count the number of times each object appears consecutively and add the count to its top-left corner.
3. Check for merging possibilities based on surrounding colors. In this case, there are no possible merges.
4. Transform objects by translating them horizontally or vertically by a single unit while maintaining connections with other objects of the same color. There are no transformations in this step.
5. No more transformations can be applied, and the desired output grid is reached.
