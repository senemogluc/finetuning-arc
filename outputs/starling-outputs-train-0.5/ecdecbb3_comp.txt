Here's the reasoning for this transformation rule:

1. In each row, find and merge adjacent objects with the same value (e.g., 8). This is done by adding the number of objects merged to the value of the first object in the sequence. For example, if there are 3 8's adjacent to each other, they become 8 + 3 = 11.
2. Remove any rows containing only zeros (0's).
3. If a row contains only one non-zero object, copy it to an empty row below the current row, and then remove the original row.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more transformations can be applied or all rows are removed.
