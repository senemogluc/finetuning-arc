Based on the transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, it seems like there are two main objects with the numbers 5 in them. These objects appear to be interacting with each other, causing some rearrangement of the 5s within them.

Here's a possible output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]
