Here's a step-by-step explanation of the transformation process for the last input case:

1. Identify and group adjacent objects with the same value:
   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - 5 times
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8] - 5 times
   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - 5 times
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. Count the number of objects in each group and assign a new value to each object based on its position within the group:
   For the groups with 5 elements ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8]), assign a new value of 2 to each element in the first 4 rows and a new value of 3 for the top-right element. For the group with 5 elements ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), assign a new value of 0 to each element.

3. Replace the original objects with their new values:
   [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] - 4 times
   [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] - 4 times
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - 1 time

4. Merge the groups with a value of 2:
   [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] - 4 times
   [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] - 4 times
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - 1 time

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the desired output is achieved:
   The final output after applying these transformations multiple times will be:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
