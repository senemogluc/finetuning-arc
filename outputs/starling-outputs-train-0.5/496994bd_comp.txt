Case 2:

Input:
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To generate the output grid, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: We have two main objects in this input grid - a 6x3 rectangle of 3's and a 2x5 rectangle of 5's. They are adjacent to each other horizontally.

2. Analyze the transformation rules: Since the two objects are adjacent, we can assume that they will interact with each other during the transformation process. In this case, it seems like the 3's object is going to "absorb" the 5's object, as there are no other objects in between them or around them.

3. Apply the transformation: We can replace the 5's object with the 3's object, as they seem to be interacting and merging into a single object. This will result in a 6x3 rectangle of 3's where the original 5's object was located.

4. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule we induced from the previous cases seems to work well with this case, as it maintains the persistence and relationships between objects.

Output:
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
