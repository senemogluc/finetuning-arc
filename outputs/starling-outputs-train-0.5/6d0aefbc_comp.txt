Case 4 Input:
[6, 8, 6]
[8, 6, 8]
[1, 6, 1]

To solve this case, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: There are three objects in the grid - a row of 6s at the top, a row of 8s in the middle, and a single 1 at the bottom. The 6s are adjacent to each other, as are the 8s. The 1 is not part of any of these objects.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are three 6s and two 8s. We can arrange them in a way that maintains their relationships.
3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: Since the 6s and 8s are already arranged in rows, we can simply replicate the pattern to create a larger grid. The 1 can be placed at the end of the new row of 8s.
4. Check whether the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: This transformation correctly handles the previous cases as well.

Output:
[6, 8, 6]
[8, 6, 8]
[1, 6, 1, 8, 6]

Here is the output grid for Case 4:

[6, 8, 6]
[8, 6, 8]
[1, 6, 1, 8, 6]
