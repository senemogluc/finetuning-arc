Here's a possible transformation rule for the given cases that can be applied to generate the desired output grid:

1. Identify and merge adjacent objects with the same color (number). This can result in larger objects being formed by merging smaller ones. For example, in Case 0, the 8s are merged into a single object.
2. Count the number of occurrences of each unique color (number) in the input grid and assign the count to an adjacent location in the output grid. For instance, in Case 1, there are 3 instances of the number 1, which are assigned to the corresponding locations in the output grid.
3. Identify and merge objects with the same color that are touching horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). This can result in larger objects being formed by merging smaller ones. For example, in Case 2, the 4s connected horizontally are merged into a single object.
4. If there's an object with the same color as its neighboring object, merge them into a single object. For instance, in Case 3, the 8s connected to the 1s and 2s are merged into a single object.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until no more merging is possible or until the desired output grid is obtained.

Using these rules, we can generate the following output grids for each case:

Case 0:
Output:
  [0]
