Based on the transformation rules induced from previous input-output pairs, we can generate the following output grid for the last given input grid:

Input:
  [1, 4, 1]
  [4, 9, 4]
  [9, 1, 9]

Output:
  [1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4]
  [4, 9, 4, 9, 4, 9]
  [1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4]
  [9, 4, 9, 4, 9, 4]
  [4, 9, 4, 9, 4, 9]
  [1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4]
