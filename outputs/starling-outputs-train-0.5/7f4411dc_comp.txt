Based on the transformation rules and previous outputs, let's analyze the last input grid:

Case 3:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]

We can observe that the objects are connected horizontally and vertically. The grid has two main groups of objects: one with the number 8 and another with the background value 0. The objects in each group share common edges. There is no occlusion or noise between these groups.

To apply the transformation rule, we can consider the following steps:

1. Identify the connected components of the same object (either 8 or 0). In this case, we have two main groups - one with 8 and another with 0.
2. For each connected component, find the smallest bounding rectangle that includes all the elements in the component.
3. If an element is part of a larger group, remove it from its current position and place it at the center of its bounding rectangle. Otherwise, leave it unchanged.
4. Reconstruct the grid by placing the components back into their new positions.

Following these steps, we can obtain the following output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]

This output grid follows the transformation rule and maintains the persistence of objects as well as their transformations.
