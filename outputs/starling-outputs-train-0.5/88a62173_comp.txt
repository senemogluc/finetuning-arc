In order to generate the output grid for the last input, let's first analyze the given input and identify any patterns or relationships between the objects.

Input:
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 5]

We can see that there are objects with the same number adjacent to each other. For example, the 5s in the top row and bottom row form a continuous object horizontally. The 5s in the second and fourth rows also form a continuous object vertically. The background (0) is present as well but doesn't create any new objects.

Based on this analysis, we can generate the following output grid:

Output:
  [5, 5]
  [5, 5]

In this case, the transformation rule involves recognizing and leveraging the continuity of objects with the same number and their relationships.
