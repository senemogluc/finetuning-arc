Here's a step-by-step analysis of the transformation rules applied to the given input grid.

1. Identify and merge adjacent objects with the same color value, where 0 represents the background. This creates larger objects formed by connecting neighboring cells with the same color.

2. Transform the grid by moving objects that are connected horizontally or vertically, based on their relative positions. In this case, we can see that there are no such cases in the given input grid.

3. Count the number of objects present in each row and column. Since all rows have 10 elements (including the background) and all columns have 10 elements (including the background), no objects need to be removed due to their size exceeding the grid boundaries.

4. Check for any objects with a count of 1 or less, which can be considered as single objects. In this case, there are no such cases in the given input grid.

5. If necessary, merge adjacent objects that touch each other horizontally or vertically (excluding corners). However, in this case, we don't need to apply any merging due to the previous steps.

6. Repeat steps 1-5 until no more changes are needed or until a fixed point is reached. In this case, only one iteration of step 1 was needed to merge all objects into larger ones. No further iterations were required.

The output grid after applying the transformation rules is as follows:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Here's the output grid after applying the transformation rules to the last input grid:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]
