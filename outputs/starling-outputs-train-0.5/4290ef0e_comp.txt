Here are the steps to find the output grid for the given input grid:

1. Identify adjacent same-numbered elements and group them as a single object. In this case, we have groups like [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2], etc.
2. Transform each group by applying the given transformation rules. For example, if the input grid has a group of objects with the same number (e.g., [1, 1, 1, 1]), we can transform it into a single object with that number, like in the output grid, this would be represented as [1].
3. Replace the original groups with their transformed versions in the input grid. For example, if the input has a group of objects with the same number (e.g., [1, 1, 1, 1]), replace it with its transformed version [1] in the output grid.
4. The resulting grid after replacing all the groups with their transformed versions is the output grid.

Here's the output grid for the last input:

[6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6]
[6, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6]
[4, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 4]
[4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4]
[4, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 4]
[6, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6]
[6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6]
