Case 4 Input:
  [6, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 8, 9]
  [2, 9, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 2, 0]
  [9, 2, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 8]
  [7, 7, 4, 0, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 7, 4]
  [4, 1, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9]
  [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [4, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0]

To find the output grid, we can apply the transformation rules as follows:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have several groups of adjacent numbers: {6, 9}, {2, 9, 0, 6, 8}, {7, 7, 4, 0, 9}, {5, 8, 9}, {1}, {0, 9, 2}, and {4, 1, 0, 0, 9}.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are no specific numerical aspects to consider in this case.
3. Recognize elementary geometry and topology concepts: The objects are mostly rectangular or square-shaped, with some touching or overlapping each other.
4. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: Since this is the last input, we cannot verify it against previous pairs. However, we can ensure that the rules are applied consistently within this case.

Based on these steps and the given input grid, the output grid for Case 4 would be as follows:

Output:
  [0, 6, 9]
  [2, 8, 9]
  [7, 7, 4]
  [5, 8, 9]
  [1]
  [0, 9, 2]
  [4, 1, 0]
  [9]
