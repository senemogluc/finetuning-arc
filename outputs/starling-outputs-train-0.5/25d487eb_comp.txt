Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Start with the last input grid:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. Identify objects and their persistence:
   - Objects with 3 or more adjacent cells with the same value (4) are persistent and can be considered as a single object.
   - There are two such objects in this grid: one with values 4 at positions [5, 1], [6, 2], [7, 3], and another with values 8 at positions [8, 4], [9, 5], [10, 6], [11, 7].

3. Apply transformations:
   - Transform the grid by moving the persistent objects to their original positions (i.e., the positions they occupied in the first input grid).

4. Final output grid:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of the last input grid is:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
