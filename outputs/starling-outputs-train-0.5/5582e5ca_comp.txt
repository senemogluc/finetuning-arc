Case 3:

Input:
  [8, 8, 6]
  [4, 6, 9]
  [8, 3, 0]

To generate the output grid, we will consider the following steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, there are three distinct objects - the top-left object with only 8s, the middle object with 4, 6, and 9, and the bottom object with only 8s. There is no physical contact between these objects.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Since there's no interaction or transformation between the objects, we can simply copy the objects to the output grid.
3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: There are no geometric transformations needed in this case.
4. Check whether the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule is consistent with the previous cases.

Based on these steps, the output grid for the last input should be:

  [8, 8, 6]
  [4, 6, 9]
  [8, 3, 0]
