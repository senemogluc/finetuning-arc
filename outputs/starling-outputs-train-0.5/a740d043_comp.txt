To determine the transformation rule for the given cases, we can analyze the patterns and relationships between the numbers in each case. Here's an overview of the observations:

1. In Case 0, there are no adjacent same numbers, so the transformation is relatively simple. The output grid has fewer rows and columns than the input grid, with the numbers 2 and 3 being transformed into the corners of a square shape.
2. In Case 1, there are adjacent same numbers forming vertical lines. The transformation rule here involves merging these lines to form single objects.
3. In Case 2, there are adjacent same numbers forming horizontal lines. The transformation rule here also involves merging these lines to form single objects. However, the pattern is slightly different from Case 1.
4. In Case 3, there are adjacent same numbers forming a square shape. The transformation rule here involves merging these squares into single objects.

Based on these observations and the priors provided, we can infer that the transformation rule for the last input (Case 3) is to merge adjacent same numbers that form a square shape into single objects. Here's the reasoning:

1. Identify the goals or intentions guiding the transformations: In this case, it's merging squares formed by adjacent same numbers into single objects.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Count the number of squares in the input grid. There are 4 squares in total.
3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: Squares are rectangular shapes with all sides equal length. The transformation rule is to merge these squares into single objects.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the last input grid (Case 3):

Input:
```less
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```
Output:
```less
[3]
[4]
[5]
```

In the output grid, we have merged the squares formed by adjacent same numbers into single objects. The numbers in each object represent the number of squares that were merged to form it.
