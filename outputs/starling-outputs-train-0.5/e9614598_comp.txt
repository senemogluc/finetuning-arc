Here's the reasoning for the transformation applied to the given input grid:

1. The background (value 0) remains unchanged throughout the transformation.
2. Objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object, so we need to merge these objects by adding their values together. For example, in the first case, the two objects with value 1 and 3 should be merged into a single object with value 4.
3. Objects persist despite noise or occlusion, so we need to maintain the integrity of the objects while applying the transformation. In this case, we can identify that there are multiple objects present in the grid, and they are not affected by each other.
4. Tasks involving counting or sorting objects require comparing numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects. In this case, we don't have any specific counting or sorting tasks to perform.
5. Elementary geometry and topology concepts can be applied to determine the transformation rule. For example, in the first case, the two objects with value 1 are merged into a single object with value 4 due to their proximity.

Based on these considerations, the output grid for the last given input (Case 2) is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
