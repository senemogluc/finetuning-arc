Based on the given transformations and priors, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input. Here are two possible outputs, each with a different interpretation of the transformation rule:

Option 1:

  [8, 8]
  [3, 8]

Option 2:

  [6, 8, 6]
  [3, 8, 3]

Both options are plausible, but the actual output would require more context or clarification of the transformation rule.
