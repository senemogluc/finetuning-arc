To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the previous cases and identify patterns or relationships between objects.

Case 0:
- Transformation Rule: Counting the number of occurrences of a specific color (number) in each row.

Case 1:
- Transformation Rule: Counting the number of occurrences of a specific color (number) in each column.

Case 2:
- Transformation Rule: Counting the number of occurrences of a specific color (number) in each diagonal.

Case 3:
- Transformation Rule: Counting the number of occurrences of a specific color (number) in a specific row or column, depending on the context.

Case 4:
- Transformation Rule: Counting the number of occurrences of a specific color (number) in each diagonal.

Case 5:
- Transformation Rule: Counting the number of occurrences of a specific color (number) in each row or column, depending on the context.

Case 6:
- Transformation Rule: Counting the number of occurrences of a specific color (number) in a specific diagonal.

Now let's apply these rules to the last input case.

Last Input Case:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the context and patterns from previous cases, we can apply the following transformation rule:

- Transformation Rule: Counting the number of occurrences of a specific color (number) in each diagonal.

Output:
[9, 1, 5]
[9, 1, 5]
[9, 1, 5]
