Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships:
   - The 6's form a rectangle with an open top, connected to the 8's on the left and right sides.
   - The 8's are part of two separate rectangles with an open bottom, connected to the 6's above them.
   - The 1's are part of a rectangle with an open bottom, connected to the 6's on the top and bottom sides.

2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic:
   - There are two rows of 8's (total of 16).
   - There is one row of 6's (total of 6).
   - The left and right rectangles with 6's have equal width, so the total number of columns for each rectangle is half of the total number of 8's (16 / 2 = 8).

3. Determine transformations:
   - The 8's in the top row are translated down by one position.
   - The 6's in the bottom row are translated up by one position.
   - The 1's are unchanged.

4. Apply elementary geometry and topology concepts:
   - The rectangle with 6's is stretched horizontally to match the width of the rectangle with 8's.
   - The rectangle with 8's is unchanged, as it occupies the entire grid width.

5. Check whether the transformation works on previous input-output pairs:
   - In Case 0, the output grid matches the given output for the first input.
   - In Case 1, the output grid matches the given output for the second input.
   - In Case 2, the output grid matches the given output for the third input.

Based on these steps and reasoning, the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
