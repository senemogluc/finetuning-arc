Here's a breakdown of the reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
- The objects are mostly single-colored squares with no counting or sorting involved.
- There is one exception in the middle row, where a 3x3 block is formed by connecting the 5's and 4's. This suggests that there might be some physical contact between these objects.
- The transformation rule for this case would involve separating single-colored squares and joining the connected 5's and 4's in the middle row into a single object.

Case 1:
- There are several instances of counting or sorting, such as the 2x2 blocks of 5's and 6's and the 2x3 blocks of 2's.
- The transformation rule for this case would involve grouping the objects based on their numerical values and joining the connected 5's and 2's into single objects.

Case 2:
- There are instances of counting or sorting, such as the 3x3 block of 8's in the middle and the 2x2 blocks of 7's and 8's at the edges.
- The transformation rule for this case would involve grouping the objects based on their numerical values and joining the connected 8's into single objects.

Case 3:
- There are instances of counting or sorting, such as the 2x2 blocks of 6's in the middle and the 2x2 blocks of 1's at the edges.
- The transformation rule for this case would involve grouping the objects based on their numerical values and joining the connected 6's into single objects.

For the last input, we can apply the transformation rule from Case 3:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 1, 1, 6]
  [0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
