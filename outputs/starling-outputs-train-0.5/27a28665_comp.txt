To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given cases:

1. Cases 0, 1, 2, and 5 all have a single number (5 or 8) surrounded by background (0), which means they represent a single object. The output is the count of these objects minus one (to account for the background).
2. Case 3 has two identical objects connected horizontally; it represents two objects. The output is the count of these objects minus one (to account for the background).
3. Cases 4 and 6 have a pair of identical objects vertically stacked, which means they represent two objects. However, in case 6, there's an additional object at the bottom right corner. The output should be the count of these objects minus one (to account for the background).

Now let's analyze the last input:

Input:
[0, 8, 0]
[8, 8, 8]
[0, 8, 0]

This input has two identical objects connected horizontally, similar to case 3. The transformation rule for this case is to count the number of objects minus one (to account for the background). There are three objects in total (two 8s and one 0), so the output should be:

Output:
[3]
