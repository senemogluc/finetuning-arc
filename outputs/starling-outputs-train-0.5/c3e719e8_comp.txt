Here's the output for the last input grid:

Input:
  [1, 1, 7]
  [7, 4, 1]
  [5, 1, 7]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid is larger than the input grid, and it shows the transformation of objects based on their relationships, persistence, and counting.
