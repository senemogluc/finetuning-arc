Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Recognize that there are several instances of the same pattern in the input grid, such as [3, 3, 3, 3] and [2, 0, 0, 0]. This suggests that we can treat these patterns as a single object.
2. Identify objects based on their values (3 or 8) and count the number of occurrences of each pattern. There are two types of patterns: [3, 3, 3, 3] and [2, 0, 0, 0]. The first pattern occurs 4 times, while the second pattern occurs 6 times.
3. Create a grid for each object type and place the corresponding number of occurrences in the output grid. For example, create a grid with 4 instances of [3, 3, 3, 3] and 6 instances of [2, 0, 0, 0].
4. Combine these grids to form the final output grid.

Here's the output grid for the last input:

[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

This output grid is smaller than the input grid, as it only contains the objects identified and their respective counts.
