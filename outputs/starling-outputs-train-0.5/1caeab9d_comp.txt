Here's a breakdown of the transformation rules and reasoning for each step:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on adjacent numbers with the same value. In this case, we have 3 main objects:
   - Object A: [2, 2] (upper left corner)
   - Object B: [4, 4, 0] (lower left corner)
   - Object C: [1, 1] (upper right corner)

2. Recognize the relationships between objects and their transformations. In this case, we have:
   - Object A is translated horizontally by 1 position to the right and merged with object C. The resulting object becomes [1, 1, 2].
   - Object B remains unchanged as it has no adjacent objects.

3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. In this case, we have:
   - Counting the number of occurrences of each value in the input grid:
     - 0 occurs 12 times
     - 1 occurs 4 times
     - 2 occurs 3 times
     - 4 occurs 3 times
   - Since object A and C are merged, the total count of 1 becomes 4. The total count of 2 is still 3, as one instance of 2 is now part of the merged object [1, 1, 2].

4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined:
   - In this case, we have a simple translation of an object without any complex geometric transformations.

5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one:
   - Option A (merged object): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Option B (unchanged object): [0, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs:
   - Case 0 and Case 1 are not affected by the transformation in Case 3, as they involve different types of transformations (persistent objects with different colors).
   - For Case 2, the transformation does not apply, as there is no translation or rebounding between objects.

Considering all these factors, the correct output for the last input grid (Case 3) should be:

Output:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
