Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify adjacent elements with the same value and count them as a single object until they are separated by another number or the edge of the grid. 
   - For example, in the first row, we have two occurrences of 0 next to each other, so we count them as a single 0.
2. Count the number of objects and their sizes (number of cells) in each object. 
   - In our first case, there are 3 objects: one with size 8, one with size 2, and one with size 2.
3. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and place the objects back into it while maintaining their relative positions from the original grid. 
   - For example, in our first case, we would place an 8x1 rectangle at position (0, 0), a 2x1 rectangle at position (2, 0), and another 2x1 rectangle at position (4, 0).
4. If there are any cells left in the output grid after placing all objects, fill them with the value of the last object's size. In our first case, we would place a 2x1 rectangle at position (6, 0).
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each input grid.

Here is the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
