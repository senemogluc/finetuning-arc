To generate the output grid that corresponds to the last given Input grid using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on adjacent numbers being part of the same object. In this case, all 6s are part of the same object.
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. There is no physical contact in this input grid.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. Since there are no operations required, we can skip this step.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. In this case, we can focus on the persistence of objects.
5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one. Since all 6s are part of the same object and there is no physical contact or transformation needed, we can keep the 6s in their original positions.
6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs. In this case, it does work for all previous cases.
7. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid. Since there is no change in the grid size, we maintain the same dimensions.

Based on these steps and reasoning, the output of the last input (case 3) will be the same as the input:
