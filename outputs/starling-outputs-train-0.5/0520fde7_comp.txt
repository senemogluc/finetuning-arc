To find the output grid for the given input grid, we will follow the steps outlined in the transformation rule. 

Input:
  [1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1]
  [1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]

We can see that the same numbers (1, 5, and 0) are adjacent to each other, forming three objects. There is no noise or occlusion, and there's no indication of physical contact between objects. The task does not involve counting or sorting objects explicitly. 

The transformation rule suggests that we should recognize the relationships between these objects and apply elementary geometry and topology concepts. In this case, we can observe that all three objects are rectangular in shape with a side length of 1 unit. 

We can combine these rectangles to form a single larger rectangle by arranging them side by side and top to bottom. This results in an output grid with dimensions 3x3.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]

The transformation works on the previous input-output pairs as well, so this is the correct output for the last given input grid.
