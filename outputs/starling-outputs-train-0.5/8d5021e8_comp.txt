To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the previous cases:

Case 0: The grid consists of a single object (8) that is mirrored along the x-axis and repeated horizontally. The grid has been stretched both horizontally and vertically.

Case 1: The grid consists of two objects (2, 0), which are mirrored along the y-axis and repeated both horizontally and vertically.

Case 2: The grid consists of a single object (5) that is mirrored along the x-axis, stretched horizontally, and then mirrored along the y-axis. The grid has been stretched both horizontally and vertically.

Based on these cases, it seems like the transformation rule involves mirroring, repetition, and stretching. 

Now let's apply this transformation rule to the last input:

Input:
  [3, 3]
  [3, 0]
  [3, 3]

To transform this grid, we can mirror it along the y-axis, repeat horizontally, and then stretch vertically. The result will be a grid with three objects (3, 0) mirrored along the y-axis, repeated horizontally, and stretched vertically. 

Here's the output grid:

  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 3]

This output grid follows the transformation rule we induced from the previous input-output pairs.
