Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on shared numbers in adjacent cells. In this case, we have two main objects: a horizontal group with 8's and a vertical group with 0's.
2. The horizontal group of 8's is connected, so it can be treated as a single object. The vertical group of 0's is also connected, so it can be treated as a single object.
3. There are no tasks involving physical contact, counting, or sorting in this input grid. Therefore, we don't need to consider these aspects for the transformation.
4. Since the objects persist despite noise and occlusion, we can keep them in their original form in the output grid. However, we can also try to optimize the arrangement of the 8's horizontally by placing them in a more compact form.
5. Based on the priors, we should apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. In this case, there are no such tasks.
6. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. Since there are no specific geometric or topological relationships between objects in this input grid, we don't need to consider these aspects for the transformation.
7. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one. In this case, we have two main options: keeping the original horizontal arrangement of 8's or optimizing it by placing them in a more compact form. Since there are no specific requirements or constraints mentioned, we can choose either option. I will choose the first option to keep the original horizontal arrangement of 8's.
8. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs. The transformation seems to work correctly for all three cases provided.
9. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid. In this case, the output grid has the same size as the input grid.

Based on the reasoning above, the output of the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
