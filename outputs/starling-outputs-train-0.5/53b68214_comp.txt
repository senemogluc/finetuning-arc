To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the previous cases and their corresponding outputs.

Case 0: The grid has a rectangular pattern with 6x3 dimensions. The pattern repeats itself horizontally. The transformation rule could be to replicate the pattern horizontally until it fits the input grid.

Case 1: The grid consists of a single object (3x3) that is replicated vertically and horizontally until it fills the entire grid. The transformation rule could be to replicate the object until the grid is filled.

Case 2: The grid has a rectangular pattern with 3x3 dimensions. The pattern repeats itself both horizontally and vertically. The transformation rule could be to replicate the pattern both horizontally and vertically until it fits the input grid.

For Case 3, we can apply the transformation rules derived from the previous cases:

1. Check if there's a horizontal repeating pattern in the input grid. In this case, there is no such pattern.

2. Check if there's a vertical or both horizontal and vertical repeating pattern in the input grid. In this case, there is a vertical repeating pattern (3x6). The transformation rule could be to replicate the object both horizontally and vertically until it fits the input grid.

Now let's apply the transformation rule to Case 3:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid for Case 3 is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
