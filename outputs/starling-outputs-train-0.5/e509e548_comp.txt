Here's the reasoning for this transformation:

1. Identify adjacent objects with the same color (value) and group them together.
2. Count the number of objects in each group.
3. For each group, if the count is odd, replace the central object with a new value equal to the sum of all values in the group minus the central object's value.
4. If the count is even, keep the original values and remove any objects that are not part of an object with an odd count.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until no more changes can be made.
