To generate the output grid for the last given input grid, we can follow the transformation rule induced from the previous cases. In this case, we have:

Input:
  [0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [9, 0, 0]

Since there are no adjacent numbers in the input grid, we don't need to apply any specific transformation rules. We can simply copy the entire input grid as the output grid:

Output:
  [0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [9, 0, 0]
