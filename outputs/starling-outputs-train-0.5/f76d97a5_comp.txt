Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case and the final output grid:

Case 0:
The input grid consists of two objects with color 4 and one object with color 5. The transformation rule states that same numbers adjacent to each other are part of the same object. Therefore, we can merge all occurrences of 4 and 5 into a single object by setting them to 0. This results in the given output grid.

Case 1:
The input grid consists of one large object with color 6 surrounding smaller objects with colors 5. The transformation rule states that objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. Therefore, we can remove all occurrences of color 5 by setting them to 0, resulting in the given output grid.

Case 2:
The input grid consists of one large object with color 9 surrounded by smaller objects with colors 5. The transformation rule states that objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. Therefore, we can remove all occurrences of color 5 by setting them to 0, resulting in the given output grid.

Case 3:
The input grid consists of a pattern with alternating colors 3 and 5. The transformation rule states that same numbers adjacent to each other are part of the same object. Therefore, we can merge all occurrences of 3 and 5 into a single object by setting them to 0, resulting in the given output grid:

Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
