To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given cases:

Case 1:
- The 9s and 5s are part of the same object, as they are adjacent to each other.
- The 9s and 5s are transformed by swapping their positions with each other.

Case 2:
- The 2s and 5s are part of the same object, as they are adjacent to each other.
- The 2s and 5s are transformed by swapping their positions with each other.

Case 3:
- The 1s and 5s are part of the same object, as they are adjacent to each other.
- The 5s in the input grid form a square pattern with a single 1 at the center. In this case, the transformation rule is not clear from the previous cases.

Based on the analysis, we can infer that the transformation rule involves swapping adjacent numbers within the same object. However, it's unclear what happens to the object in Case 3, as there is no prior information available. 

Given the limited information and inconsistency in the cases, it's not possible to determine a consistent transformation rule for the last input grid.
