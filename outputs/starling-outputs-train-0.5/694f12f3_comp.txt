Here are my steps to generate the output grid for the last input grid:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid. In this case, there are only one type of object (number 4). So, the transformation rule is simple: keep all instances of number 4 in the output grid.
2. Apply the transformation rule to the input grid. Since there's only one type of object (number 4), the output grid will be the same as the input grid.
3. Check whether the transformation works on previous input-output pairs. It does, as the output grids for Case 0 and Case 1 are also the same as their respective input grids.

So, the output of the last input is:

  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
