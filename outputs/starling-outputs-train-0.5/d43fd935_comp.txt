Here's a brief analysis of each case to understand the transformation rules and then the output for the last input:

Case 0:
The input grid has two main objects: one with numbers 1, 3, and 6, and another with numbers 7, 8, and 0. The transformation rule is to keep these objects intact but arrange them in a specific pattern. In this case, the pattern is alternating rows of the two objects.

Case 1:
The input grid has four main objects: one with number 7 (occurring twice), another with numbers 3 and 8, and two more with numbers 0 and 1. The transformation rule is to keep these objects intact but arrange them in a specific pattern. In this case, the pattern is alternating columns of the first three objects (7, 3, 8) and rows of the last two objects (0, 1).

Case 2:
The input grid has four main objects: one with number 1 (occurring twice), another with numbers 3 and 3, and two more with numbers 0 and 0. The transformation rule is to keep these objects intact but arrange them in a specific pattern. In this case, the pattern is alternating rows of the first three objects (1, 3, 3) and columns of the last two objects (0, 0).

Case 3:
The input grid has four main objects: one with number 2 (occurring twice), another with numbers 6 and 0, and two more with numbers 0 and 6. The transformation rule is to keep these objects intact but arrange them in a specific pattern. In this case, the pattern is alternating rows of the first three objects (2, 6, 0) and columns of the last two objects (0, 6).
