Given the transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the goal in each case is to rearrange the objects (numbers) while maintaining their adjacency. We should also try to maximize the number of contiguous groups of the same number.

In the last input grid, we have:

Input:
  [6, 4, 4]
  [6, 6, 4]
  [4, 6, 7]

To maximize the number of contiguous groups of the same number, we can rearrange the grid as follows:

Output:
  [6, 6, 4]
  [6, 4, 4]
  [4, 6, 7]

In this output grid, we have two contiguous groups of 6s and one group of 4s. The grid is also smaller than the input grid, which aligns with the transformation rules provided.
