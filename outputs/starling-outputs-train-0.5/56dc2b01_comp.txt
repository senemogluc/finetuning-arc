To determine the transformation rule for each case, we should consider the given priors and analyze the input-output pairs. Here's an analysis for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation seems to involve moving objects horizontally from right to left while maintaining their shape and color. The output grid is smaller than the input grid, with fewer instances of the number 3 and one additional instance of the number 2.

Case 1:
In this case, it appears that objects are being moved diagonally down-right while retaining their shape and color. The transformation also involves rotating some objects by 90 degrees clockwise. The output grid is larger than the input grid, with additional instances of the number 8.

Case 2:
The transformation in this case seems to involve moving objects diagonally down-left while maintaining their shape and color. Similar to Case 1, there's a rotation of some objects by 90 degrees clockwise. The output grid is larger than the input grid, with additional instances of the number 8.

Case 3:
In this case, it appears that objects are being moved diagonally down-right while retaining their shape and color. Similar to Case 1, there's a rotation of some objects by 90 degrees clockwise. The output grid is larger than the input grid, with additional instances of the number 8.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rules are consistent across all cases:

1. Moving objects diagonally down-right while maintaining their shape and color.
2. Rotating some objects by 90 degrees clockwise.
3. The output grid is larger than the input grid, with additional instances of the number 8.

Now, let's generate the output grid for Case 3 using these transformation rules:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In summary, the output of Case 3 is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
