Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on the priors:
   - Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object (e.g., [2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2])
   - Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. In many cases, objects from the input persist in a transformed form on the output grid.
   - Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects (e.g., [2, 0, 2] and [2, 2, 2]).

2. Based on the identified objects, we can infer that there are four main objects:
   - Object A: [2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2]
   - Object B: [2, 0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2]
   - Object C: [2, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]
   - Object D: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4] (independent object)

3. Analyze the interactions between objects and their transformations:
   - Object A collides with Object B at position [2, 0]. After collision, Object A moves to the right and Object B moves downward.
   - Object C collides with Object D at position [2, 2]. After collision, Object C moves upwards while Object D remains stationary.

4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects:
   - Count the number of occurrences of each object in the output grid.

5. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined:
   - Determine the final positions of objects after their interactions and transformations.

6. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one:
   - Object A moves right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit, resulting in position [3, 1].
   - Object B moves down by 1 unit, resulting in position [2, 1, 0, 2].
   - Object C moves up by 1 unit, resulting in position [2, 1, 2, 0].
   - Object D remains stationary at position [4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

7. Check whether the transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs:
   - The transformation rule seems consistent with the previous cases and produces the correct output for each case.

8. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid:
   - In this case, the output grid is the same size as the input grid.

Final Output Grid:
  [3, 1, 0, 2]
  [2, 1, 0, 2]
  [2, 1, 2, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
