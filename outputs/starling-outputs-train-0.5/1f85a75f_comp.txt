Here are some transformations that can be observed in the input grid:

1. Merge adjacent objects with the same color.
2. Persist objects through contact or physical collision with other objects. This persistence should not be affected by the object's size, shape, or positioning on the grid.
3. Treatment of 0 as a special object that can merge with any object. The 0 is treated as if it were an object of the same color and type as the nearest object in its immediate neighborhood (up to 8 adjacent objects).
4. Counting the number of objects merged, which helps determine persistence.
5. Elementary geometric concepts like linearity, topology, and adjacency are used for determining merges and transformations.
6. Basic arithmetic is used to reason about the output grid size and shape.
7. Consideration of numerical aspects and counting of objects merged in each step, helping to determine persistence and object relationships.
8. The use of colors as a property of objects, which can be merged together with other objects.
9. Objects are treated as having certain properties such as color, shape, size, and position on the grid.
10. Treatment of 3 as a special number that is treated as if it were an object of the same color and type as the nearest object in its immediate neighborhood (up to 8 adjacent objects).
