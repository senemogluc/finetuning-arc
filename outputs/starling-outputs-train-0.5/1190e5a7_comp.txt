Here are the steps I took to derive the transformation rule and apply it to the given input grid:

1. Identify priors: The priors in this case are that objects with the same number adjacent to each other belong to the same object, objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects, recognition of tasks involving counting or sorting objects, comparing numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects, and elementary geometry and topology concepts.
2. Analyze input grids: In all three cases, we can observe that the 3x3 blocks with a single number in the center are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with some noise or occlusion by other objects. The main goal is to separate these 3x3 blocks into their own distinct objects.
3. Transformation rule: Based on the identified priors and the analysis of input grids, the transformation rule can be derived as follows:
   - Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
   - Objects are assumed to persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.
4. Apply the transformation rule to the last input grid:
   - Identify and separate 3x3 blocks with a single number in the center.
   - Remove any noise or occlusion that doesn't belong to these 3x3 blocks.
5. Output grid: The output grid after applying the transformation rule to the last input grid is as follows:

Output:
  [1, 1]
  [1, 1]
