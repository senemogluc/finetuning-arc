To generate the output grid for the last given input grid, we can apply the transformation rule derived from the previous cases. Here's the reasoning step by step:

1. Identify the objects and their relationships in the input grid. In this case, we have 3 main objects with different colors (2, 6, and 8). Objects 2 and 6 are touching each other horizontally, while object 8 is a separate object.
2. Apply the transformation rule to maintain the persistence of these objects despite noise or occlusion by other objects. In this case, we can consider that the objects are not affected by the background (0).

3. Now, let's apply the transformation rule to each object:
   - For object 2: Since it is touching another object (6), we can rotate it by 90 degrees counterclockwise and place it next to object 8 without overlapping. The new coordinates for object 2 would be [3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 7, 3, 5, 3].
   - For object 6: As mentioned earlier, we can rotate it by 90 degrees counterclockwise and place it next to object 8 without overlapping. The new coordinates for object 6 would be [2, 4, 2, 7, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1].
   - For object 8: It is a separate object that does not interact with the other objects. We can leave it as is. The new coordinates for object 8 would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0].
4. Combine the transformed objects into an output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 4, 2, 7, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
