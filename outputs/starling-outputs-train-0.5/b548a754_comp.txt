Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation process for the last input grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships:
   - The main object in this grid is a 3x3 square with numbers 6, 4, and 6 at its corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-right). It has an empty space at the center (0).
   - There are also two smaller objects consisting of three consecutive 1s. One is in the top row (from left to right), and the other is in the second row (also from left to right).
   - The larger object with numbers 6, 4, and 6 at its corners appears to be rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees. We can see this by comparing it with the previous input-output pairs.

2. Apply the transformation rule:
   - Rotate the larger object with numbers 6, 4, and 6 at its corners counterclockwise by 90 degrees to form a rectangle with numbers 6, 6, 6, and 4 at its corners. This will create two new objects: one with numbers 6, 6, and 6 at its corners, and another with numbers 6 and 4 at its corners.
   - The smaller objects (three consecutive 1s) remain the same as they are not part of the larger object's transformation.

3. Combine the transformed objects:
   - Place the two new objects formed in step 2 next to each other, with their left edges aligned and a 0 at the center of the combined shape. This will create a rectangle with numbers 6, 6, 6, and 4 at its corners, and three consecutive 1s as a separate object.
   - Fill the rest of the grid with zeros.

Here's the output grid for the last input:
