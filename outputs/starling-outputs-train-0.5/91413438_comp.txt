Here are the steps to create the Output grid using the transformation rule induced from previous cases:

1. Identify adjacent objects with the same number (e.g., [6, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0], and [0, 8, 0]). For each of these adjacent objects, combine them into a single object.
2. Preserve objects' persistence despite noise or occlusion by other objects. In this case, no objects are affected by noise or occlusions.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects (e.g., translation, rebounding, or other interactions). In this case, there are no apparent interactions.
4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects. In this case, the only object that needs attention is the [0, 8, 0] object. It's a single object with two 0s and one 8.
5. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. In this case, there are no numerical aspects to consider.
6. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined earlier. In this case, no geometric or topological concepts need to be applied.
7. Check whether the transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs. The transformation seems consistent with the previous cases.

Based on these steps and the provided Input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This is the output of the last input.
