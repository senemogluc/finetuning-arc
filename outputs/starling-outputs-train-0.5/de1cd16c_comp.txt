Here are the steps to derive the transformation rule and find the output grid for the given input grid:

1. Identify adjacent objects with the same number value. In this case, we can see that there are several instances of 3's connected horizontally and vertically. Similarly, there are instances of 4's, 6's, and 8's connected.
2. Consider the persistence of these objects despite noise or occlusion by other objects. In this case, all the numbered objects persist throughout the grid.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Here, we can see that there are two types of objects: 8's and other numbers (3, 4, and 6). The 8's form a boundary around the other numbers.
4. Pay attention to object relationships, transformations, and persistence. In this case, the 8's appear to be a frame or container for the other numbers, which are all connected within this frame.
5. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. Here, we can count the number of 8's in each row and column: 
   - In rows: 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 6 (counting from bottom to top)
   - In columns: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (counting from left to right)

Based on the above analysis and transformation rule, we can derive the output grid as follows:

Output Grid:

[2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 6]
