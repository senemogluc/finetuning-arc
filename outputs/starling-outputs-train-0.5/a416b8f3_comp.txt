To determine the output grid for the given input grid, we will apply the transformation rules and reasoning from the previous cases. Here's the input grid:

Input:
  [4, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 6, 0]
  [6, 6, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1]

We can see that there are several instances of the same number adjacent to each other:

* 4s in the first row and second row
* 5s in the second row and third row
* 6s in the third row and fourth row
* 1 in the fourth row and fifth row

Applying the transformation rules, we can create an output grid that preserves these relationships:

Output:
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 5, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 6, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0]
  [6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

This output grid maintains the relationships between the numbers in the input grid and follows the transformation rules.
