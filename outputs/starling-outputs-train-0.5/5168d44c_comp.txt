Case 3:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To generate the output grid for this input, we can apply the following transformation rule:

1. Identify objects by considering adjacent numbers with the same value (e.g., 2s and 3s).
2. Preserve objects through noise or occlusion.
3. Apply counting or sorting tasks if needed.
4. Recognize physical contact, such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. We can identify 2 distinct objects in the input grid:
   - Object A: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object B: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3], and [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. We can see that Object A is not affected by noise or occlusion, so it remains unchanged. For Object B:
   - The first occurrence of Object B has no adjacent objects to interact with, so it remains unchanged.
   - In the second occurrence, Object B interacts with a 3 (from Object B itself), resulting in the transformation [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The third occurrence of Object B is also affected by the 3 from the second occurrence, resulting in the transformation [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
