Based on the provided transformations and reasoning, here's the output for the last input grid:

[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is smaller than the input grid and follows the transformation rules.
