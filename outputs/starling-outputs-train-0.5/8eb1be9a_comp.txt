Based on the previous input-output pairs and the transformation rules inferred from them, it is difficult to determine a unique output for the given input. The transformation rules are not explicitly defined for this specific case, and applying the general rules may lead to multiple possible outputs. 

To provide an accurate output grid, more context or information about the desired transformation would be needed.
