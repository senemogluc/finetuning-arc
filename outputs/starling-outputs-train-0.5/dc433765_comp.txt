Case 7:

To find the output grid for the last input, we can follow the same transformation rule as in previous cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Identify adjacent numbers that are part of the same object. In this case, there are two objects with values 3 and 4. They are not adjacent to each other.
2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Comparing the sizes of these objects (3x1 and 4x1), we can see that they are similar in size but have different values. There is no need for rearrangement based on counting or sorting criteria.

Since there is no physical contact between the objects, their positions remain unchanged. The transformation rule does not require any specific action to be taken in this case.

Thus, the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
