Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on adjacent numbers being part of the same object. In this case, we have three main objects: one with 3 (top left), another with 4 (top right), and a third with 8 (bottom center). The background is represented by zeros.

2. Apply the transformation rule, considering the priors mentioned earlier:
   - Objects persist despite noise or occlusion: In this case, there's no noise or occlusion.
   - Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: There's no direct physical contact between objects in this input grid.
   - Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects: In this case, we don't have a specific counting or sorting task.

3. Based on the priors and the identified objects, the transformation rule should maintain the shape of each object while possibly applying some symmetry or rotation if it exists within the object itself. However, in this input grid, there's no apparent symmetry or rotation needed for the objects.

4. Apply the transformation to the input grid:
   - For the 3-object (top left), we can apply a reflection along its vertical axis to create a symmetrical shape. The transformed object becomes [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3].
   - For the 4-object (top right), we can leave it as is since there's no apparent symmetry or rotation needed.
   - For the 8-object (bottom center), we can apply a reflection along its vertical axis to create a symmetrical shape. The transformed object becomes [0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8].

5. Combine the transformed objects with the background to form the output grid:

   Output:
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
     [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This is the output grid corresponding to the last given input grid using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs.
