Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the goal in this case is to create a larger grid that represents all possible combinations of the numbers in the input grid. Here's how the output grid would look like for the last input:

Input:
  [2, 9, 2]
  [8, 5, 2]
  [2, 2, 8]

Output:
  [2, 9, 2]
  [8, 5, 2]
  [2, 2, 8]
  [9, 8, 5]
  [2, 2, 8]
  [2, 9, 2]
  [8, 5, 2]
  [2, 2, 8]

In this case, the output grid is larger than the input grid and represents all possible combinations of the numbers in the input grid.
