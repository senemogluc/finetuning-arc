Here are the rules induced from the previous input-output pairs:

1. Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
2. Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. In many cases, objects from the input persist in a transformed form on the output grid, often with translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. This may include translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
5. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
6. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined.
7. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one.
8. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs.
9. The output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.

Now, let's analyze the last input:

Input:
  [4, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 4, 5, 4, 4, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0, 5, 4, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Output:

To apply the rules, let's identify objects and their transformations:

1. The object with value 4 is present in the first row and second column of the input grid. It forms a straight line along the horizontal axis. In the output grid, this object should maintain its shape but might be shifted horizontally due to physical contact between elements or occlusion.
2. The object with value 5 is present in the third row and fourth column of the input grid. It forms a straight line along the vertical axis. In the output grid, this object should maintain its shape but might be shifted vertically due to physical contact between elements or occlusion.
3. The remaining objects (0 and background) don't have any specific shape or interaction with other objects. They can remain unchanged in the output grid.

Based on these observations, we can create an output grid that follows the rules:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid follows the rules and maintains the persistence of objects, their shapes, and interactions between elements.
