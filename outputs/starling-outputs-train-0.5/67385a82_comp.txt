Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, I will generate the output grid for the last input:

Input:
  [3, 0, 3, 0, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Output:
  [8, 0, 8, 0, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0]

This output grid takes into account the adjacent numbers being part of the same object, persistence of objects despite noise or occlusion, and recognition of tasks involving counting or sorting objects.
