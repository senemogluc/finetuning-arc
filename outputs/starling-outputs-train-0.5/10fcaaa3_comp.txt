Here's the reasoning for each step and then the final output grid:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid: There are two main objects - one with value 3 (at positions (1,2) and (5,4)) and the other with value 0 (everywhere else).
2. Apply the transformation rule for persistence and relationships: The object with value 3 is present at both (1,2) and (5,4), so we need to connect them in the output grid. Similarly, the object with value 0 needs to be connected across the input grid.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: We have two objects with different values. The object with value 3 appears twice, while the object with value 0 appears everywhere else. So, we need to ensure that there are at least three occurrences of the object with value 3 in the output grid.
4. Apply elementary geometry and topology concepts: Connecting the two instances of the object with value 3 in a horizontal line will maintain their persistence and relationships. Also, connect all the instances of the object with value 0 to ensure it appears everywhere else.
5. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule seems consistent with the previous cases.

Based on this reasoning, here's the output grid for the last input:
```sql
[8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
