Based on the given priors and transformations, it's challenging to determine a unique output for the last input without more context or information about the specific task. It would be helpful to have additional details or constraints regarding the problem. 

However, as an example, one possible transformation could be to arrange the numbers in a specific pattern:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that this example is just one possible transformation and may not be relevant to the specific problem you are trying to solve.
