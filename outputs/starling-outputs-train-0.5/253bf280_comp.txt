Here are the steps to find the transformation rule and apply it to the last input:

1. Identify adjacent numbers with the same value as part of the same object. In this case, we can see that 8's are adjacent horizontally (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]).

2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can see that there are groups of 3's (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3] and [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]).

3. Apply basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects (e.g., adding or subtracting numbers). In this case, we can see that the sum of the numbers in each group is equal to the number of objects in that group (e.g., [0, 8, 0] becomes [0, 3, 3] and [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3]).

4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined (e.g., recognizing connected components or holes). In this case, we can see that the objects are connected horizontally and vertically, forming a grid.

Based on these steps, here's the transformation rule:

- If an object consists of a single number surrounded by 8's, replace it with the sum of the number and the number of 8's surrounding it (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3] becomes [0, 3, 3]).
- If an object consists of a single number surrounded by other numbers that are not 8's, replace it with the sum of the number and the number of surrounding objects with the same value (e.g., [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0] becomes [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]).
- If an object consists of multiple numbers connected horizontally or vertically, replace it with the sum of all the numbers in the object (e.g., [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 8, 3, 3, 3]).

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the last input:

  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
