Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine an exact output for the provided input grid without more context or information about the specific task at hand. However, I can provide a possible interpretation of the input and suggest an output based on the available information:

Case 5 Input:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Output:
[0, 1, 0]
[1, 0, 1]
[0, 0, 1]

This output assumes that the grid represents objects with different colors (numbers), and the transformation rule focuses on preserving these objects while possibly rearranging or merging them. In this case, the input seems to consist of two distinct objects (1's) connected by a single object (0's). The output shows a possible transformation where the two 1's are merged into a single object with the background (0's).

Please note that without more context or specific rules for this case, there might be other valid outputs as well.
