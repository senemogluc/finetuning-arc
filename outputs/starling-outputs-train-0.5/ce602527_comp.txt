Here are the steps to derive the transformation rule and find the output grid for the last given input grid:

1. Analyze the patterns in each case and identify any recurring transformations or relationships between objects.
2. Observe that in Cases 1, 3, and 4, there are groups of contiguous objects with the same number value (e.g., 8s in Case 1, 3s in Cases 3 and 4). These groups seem to be transformed by moving or rotating them as a whole.
3. In Case 2, observe that there are groups of contiguous objects with different number values (e.g., 2s, 8s), and the transformations involve rearranging these groups while maintaining their relative positions within the grid.
4. For Cases 1, 3, and 4, we can identify the transformation rules as follows:
   - Case 1: Rotate the group of 8s by 90 degrees clockwise.
   - Case 3: Move the group of 3s one position to the right.
   - Case 4: Rotate the entire grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise, then move the group of 3s two positions to the left.
5. For Case 2, we can identify the transformation rule as follows:
   - Swap the positions of the groups of 2s and 8s in a zigzag pattern across the grid.
6. Apply the identified transformation rules to the last input grid (Case 4):
   - Rotate the entire grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise, then move the group of 3s two positions to the left.

Here's the output grid for the last given input grid (Case 4):
