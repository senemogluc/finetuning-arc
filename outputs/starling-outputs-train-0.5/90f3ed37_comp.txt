Here's the reasoning behind each step and the final output:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent numbers (8) and background (0). In this case, there are two main objects: a horizontal row of 8s and a vertical column of 8s.
2. The horizontal row of 8s has a length of 9 units (including the first and last 8s). The vertical column of 8s has a length of 3 units (including the first and last 8s).
3. Recognize that there are two separate transformations happening:
   a. The horizontal row of 8s is sliding downwards by one unit, while the vertical column remains stationary. This transformation occurs in steps 2-5.
   b. The vertical column of 8s moves to the right by one unit, while the horizontal row remains stationary. This transformation occurs in steps 6-9.
4. Apply the transformations and update the output grid accordingly:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
