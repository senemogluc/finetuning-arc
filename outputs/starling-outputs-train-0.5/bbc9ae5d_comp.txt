Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves replicating the number in a grid pattern. Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same numbers: The objects are formed by the numbers 1, 7, and 8, as they appear as single-digit values in the input grid. There are no other objects present.
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: In this case, there is no direct interaction or transformation between the objects.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Counting the occurrences of each number in the input grid, we have 1 (4 times), 7 (1 time), and 8 (2 times). The total number of elements in the input grid is 12.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: Since there are no rotations or transformations involved, we can simply replicate each object based on its count.
5. Write down your reasoning for each option: As the objects don't interact with each other, we can place them in a grid pattern without any specific order. The 1s can be placed in a 4x1 grid, the 7 in a 1x1 grid, and the 8s in a 2x2 grid.
6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: This transformation rule works for all previous cases, as each number is replicated based on its count in the input grid.

Based on these steps, the output grid for the last input would be:

[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0]
[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
