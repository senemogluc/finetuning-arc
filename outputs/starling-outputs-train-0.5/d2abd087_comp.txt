Here's a step-by-step reasoning process for each case and the final output:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to involve grouping adjacent same numbered cells together. The objects are persistent, but they can be rotated or flipped. Counting and basic arithmetic are involved in the tasks of sorting and counting objects. 

To apply the transformation, we can look for groups of the same numbers and try to minimize the number of unique colors. This means merging adjacent cells with the same color value into a single cell with that color value. Here's how we can do it:

1. Start by looking at the leftmost column. We have 0, 0, 5, 5, and 5. Since they are all the same, merge them into a single cell with the value 5. Repeat this process for other columns if needed.
2. Move to the top row and look at the cells with values 0, 0, 5, and 5. Again, since they are all the same, merge them into a single cell with the value 5. Repeat this process for other rows if needed.
3. Continue this process until no more adjacent cells with the same value can be merged. After applying these transformations, we get the following output:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
