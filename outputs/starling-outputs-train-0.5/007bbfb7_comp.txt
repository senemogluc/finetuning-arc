Here are my thoughts on each case and how I arrived at the output:

Case 0: The transformation rule here seems to be that all instances of a number in the grid persist, even if they are spread out across multiple rows. The grid is expanded horizontally to accommodate these instances. 

Case 1: This case appears to have some noise (the 0's) but the main object, represented by '4', persists and is rearranged in a way that maintains its shape as much as possible. 

Case 2: Here, the transformation rule seems to be about maintaining the integrity of the main object while spreading out its parts. The grid expands horizontally to accommodate all instances of the number.

Case 3: In this case, the main objects are '6's and they persist even though they have been spread across multiple rows. The grid is expanded both vertically and horizontally to accommodate these instances.

Case 4: Here, the transformation rule appears to involve maintaining the integrity of the main object while spreading out its parts. The grid expands horizontally to accommodate all instances of the number.

Now, for the last input case (Case 5):

Input:
  [7, 0, 7]
  [7, 0, 7]
  [7, 7, 0]

Here, the transformation rule seems to be about maintaining the integrity of the main object while spreading out its parts. The grid expands horizontally to accommodate all instances of the number.

So, based on these observations and reasoning, the output for the last input would be:

  [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7]
  [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]
