Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves identifying and grouping same-numbered adjacent cells, as well as recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. 

For Case 3, let's analyze the input grid:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

We can identify two 6x6 blocks of same-numbered cells. The transformation rule should group these cells together and create an output grid with the same number of rows and columns as the input grid but with the grouped cells represented by a single cell with the sum of the values in each block. 

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the two 6x6 blocks of same-numbered cells:
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] with a single 6x6 block containing only 0s.
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] with two 6x6 blocks containing only the number 6.

2. Sum the values in each block:
   - The first block has only 0s, so its sum is 0.
   - For the second block, sum the values in the top-left and bottom-left blocks: 6 + 6 = 12.

3. Replace the original blocks with a single cell containing the sum of their values:
   - Replace the first block with a single cell containing 0.
   - Replace the second block with a single cell containing 12.

4. Fill in the remaining cells with 0s, as they don't belong to any grouped blocks.

The output grid is:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rule and the given priors.
