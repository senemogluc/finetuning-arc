Based on the transformation rule and priors provided, we can infer that objects with the same number are part of the same object. In each case, the input grid has a central pattern of 8s surrounded by 5s. The transformation rule seems to involve counting and sorting objects (in this case, the numbers 5 and 8).

For the last input grid (Case 6), we can see that the central pattern of 8s is larger than in previous cases. To apply the transformation rule, we need to count and sort the objects (numbers) in the grid. The central pattern of 8s consists of 12 8s, while there are 16 5s surrounding them.

To create the output grid, we can replace the central pattern of 8s with a single 0, leaving the outer layer of 5s intact:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rule and priors provided.
