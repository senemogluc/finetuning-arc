Based on the priors and reasoning from previous cases, the transformation rule we can infer is to replace all adjacent numbers with their sum if they are part of a connected component. In this case, the last input grid has only one connected component, so the transformation rule will not change any values in the grid. 

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]
