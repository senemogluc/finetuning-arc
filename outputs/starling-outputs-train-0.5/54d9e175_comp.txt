Here's the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs:

1. Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
2. Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. In many cases, objects from the input persist in the output grid, often in a transformed form.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. This may include translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
5. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
6. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined.
7. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one.
8. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs.
9. The output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.

For the last input, we have:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

We can see that the input grid consists of several objects with same numbers adjacent to each other. We need to recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects and compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.

To generate the output grid, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify and count the number of objects in the input grid. In this case, there are 5 objects (two 5x3 rectangles, one 5x5 square, and two 1x2 horizontal lines).
2. For each object, apply a transformation rule that maintains the structure of the object while also incorporating any interactions with other objects.
3. Combine the transformed objects to create the output grid.

For the given input, we can transform each object as follows:

- The two 5x3 rectangles: Add an extra row and column around them, and shift the entire rectangle one position down and to the right.
- The 5x5 square: Add an extra row and column around it, and shift the entire square one position down and to the right.
- The two 1x2 horizontal lines: Rotate each line by 90 degrees clockwise.

After applying these transformations, we can combine the transformed objects to create the output grid:

Output:
  [6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6]
