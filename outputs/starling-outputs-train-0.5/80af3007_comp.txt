Here's a possible transformation rule that can be induced from the previous input-output pairs:

1. Identify and separate each object by its unique color (number). This means grouping together adjacent same-colored elements.
2. Rotate each object 90 degrees clockwise if it is surrounded by objects of different colors. If an object has only one neighbor, rotate it if the neighbor's number is greater than its own.
3. Repeat step 2 until no more rotations are possible.
4. Merge adjacent objects with the same color and the same size (number) into a single object.
5. If there are any leftover isolated objects, merge them in a horizontal or vertical line from left to right or top to bottom, respectively, depending on the size of the objects.
6. Remove any empty rows or columns at the beginning or end of the grid if they appear after step 5.

Now let's apply this rule to the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5]
  [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the transformation:

1. The grid is already separated into unique objects based on color (number).
2. No rotations are needed as there are no adjacent objects of different colors or single objects with a neighbor having a greater number.
3. Since no rotations are needed, we move to step 4. Merge adjacent objects with the same color and the same size (number). In this case, all objects are already merged.
4. There are no leftover isolated objects, so we don't need to merge them in a horizontal or vertical line.
5. The grid remains unchanged after step 6 since there are no empty rows or columns at the beginning or end of the grid.

Thus, the output for the last input is:
  [5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5]
  [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
