The transformation rule we induced from the previous input-output pairs involves recognizing and leveraging elementary geometry and topology concepts. In this case, we can identify several objects in the grid that are connected to each other or have a specific shape.

Here's an analysis of the last input grid:

1. The first object is formed by the numbers 3, which appear as a triangle in the upper-left corner. This object consists of the following cells: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]
2. The second object is a square of numbers 7 surrounding a central cell with number 3. It's formed by these cells: [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
3. The third object is another square of numbers 7 surrounding a central cell with number 3. It's formed by these cells: [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
4. The fourth object is the background, which consists of all the remaining cells with a value of 0.

Now, let's apply our transformation rule to each of these objects:

1. For the triangle object, we can rotate it by 90 degrees counterclockwise and place it in the same position without overlapping other objects. The new grid will look like this:
   [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. For the square object with a central cell of number 3, we can move it one position to the left and rotate it by 90 degrees counterclockwise. The new grid will look like this:
   [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

3. For the second square object with a central cell of number 3, we can move it one position to the left and rotate it by 90 degrees counterclockwise as well. The new grid will look like this:
   [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

4. For the background, we don't need to make any changes since it is formed by cells with a value of 0.

After applying these transformations, the output grid will be:

Output:
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
