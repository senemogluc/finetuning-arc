Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer the following transformation rule:

1. Group objects with the same number together and preserve their shapes.
2. Consider the physical contact between objects as a part of the transformation.
3. Preserve the relationships between objects during the transformation process.
4. Count and sort objects if necessary.
5. Apply basic arithmetic operations if needed.

Now, let's analyze the last input grid:

Input:
  [2, 8, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1]
  [4, 4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 4]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 7, 3]
  [1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3]
  [4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 8, 4]
  [3, 2, 8, 4, 1, 8, 4]
  [1, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Using the transformation rule, we can identify the following objects and their relationships:

- Object A (2, 8): Connected to object B (1, 3) by a diagonal line.
- Object B (1, 3): Connected to object C (4, 4) by a horizontal line.
- Object C (4, 4): Connected to object D (1, 1) by a horizontal line.
- Object D (1, 1): Connected to object E (1, 1) by a diagonal line.
- Object E (1, 1): Connected to object F (1, 2) by a horizontal line.
- Object F (1, 2): Connected to object G (3, 4) by a horizontal line.
- Object G (3, 4): Connected to object H (4, 7) by a diagonal line.
- Object H (4, 7): Connected to object I (1, 4) by a diagonal line.
- Object I (1, 4): Connected to object J (2, 3) by a horizontal line.
- Object J (2, 3): Connected to object K (3, 8) by a horizontal line.
- Object K (3, 8): Connected to object L (7, 1) by a diagonal line.
- Object L (7, 1): Connected to object M (4, 1) by a horizontal line.
- Object M (4, 1): Connected to object N (1, 1) by a horizontal line.

Now let's apply the transformation rule:

1. Group objects with the same number together and preserve their shapes.
2. Consider the physical contact between objects as a part of the transformation.
3. Preserve the relationships between objects during the transformation process.
4. Count and sort objects if necessary.
5. Apply basic arithmetic operations if needed.

After applying these rules, we get the following output grid:

Output:
  [2, 8, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1]
  [4, 4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 4]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 7, 3]
  [1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3]
  [4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 8, 4]
  [3, 2, 8, 4, 1, 8, 4]
  [1, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
