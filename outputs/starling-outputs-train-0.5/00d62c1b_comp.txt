Here are the steps to find the output for the given input:

1. Identify adjacent same numbers and treat them as a single object.
2. Count the number of occurrences of each number in a row or column.
3. If the count is odd, replicate the number across all occurrences. Otherwise, concatenate the numbers with a 0 between them.
4. If there are any remaining single numbers, place them at the end of the output grid.

Following these steps for the last input:

1. Identify adjacent same numbers and treat them as a single object.
   - [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
   - [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
   - [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. Count the number of occurrences of each number in a row or column.
   - Occurrence count: {0: 8, 3: 6}

3. If the count is odd, replicate the number across all occurrences. Otherwise, concatenate the numbers with a 0 between them.
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0]

4. If there are any remaining single numbers, place them at the end of the output grid. In this case, there are no remaining single numbers.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0]
