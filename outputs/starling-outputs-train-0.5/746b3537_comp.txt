To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given cases:

Case 0: The grid has three objects (1, 2, and 3) with each object appearing twice. The output grid shows only one occurrence of each object in a single row or column. This indicates that the transformation rule is removing all but one instance of each object from the input grid.

Case 1: The grid has a single object (4) appearing three times. The output grid simply repeats this object three times, which aligns with the rule from Case 0.

Case 2: The grid has two objects (3 and 8) alternating with another object (1). The output grid removes all instances of the object (1) and compresses the remaining alternating objects into a single row or column for each distinct object.

Case 3: Similar to Case 0, the grid has three objects (2, 6, and 8) with each object appearing twice. The output grid shows only one occurrence of each object in a single row or column, again following the rule from Case 0.

Case 4: This case is a combination of Cases 0 and 2. The grid has four objects (2, 3, 4, and 8) with varying frequencies. The output grid removes all but one instance of each object and compresses the remaining alternating objects into a single row or column for each distinct object.

Case 5: This case is also a combination of Cases 0 and 2. The grid has five objects (1, 2, 3, 4, and 8) with varying frequencies. The output grid removes all but one instance of each object and compresses the remaining alternating objects into a single row or column for each distinct object.

Based on the analysis above, the transformation rule is as follows:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid (distinct numbers).
2. Remove all but one instance of each object.
3. Compress the remaining alternating objects into a single row or column for each distinct object.

Now let's apply this rule to the last input grid:

Input:
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [2, 2, 2, 2]
  [2, 2, 2, 2]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [3, 3, 3, 3]

1. Identify the objects: {4, 2, 8, 3}
2. Remove all but one instance of each object: {4, 2, 8, 3}
3. Compress the remaining alternating objects into a single row or column for each distinct object:

Output:
  [4, 2, 8, 3]

This output grid follows the transformation rule derived from the previous input-output pairs.
