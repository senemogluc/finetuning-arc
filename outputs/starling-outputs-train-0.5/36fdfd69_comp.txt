Here's a possible interpretation of the transformation rules that can be applied to the given grid:

1. Merge adjacent 9s horizontally or vertically into a single larger 9. This can be done by counting the number of adjacent 9s and replacing them with a single 9. For example, in the input [2, 9, 9], it becomes [4].

2. Replace all 0s with the sum of adjacent non-zero numbers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). This can be done by iterating through the grid and checking each cell's neighbors, adding their values, and replacing the original 0 with the sum. For example, in the input [2, 9, 0], it becomes [11].

3. Remove all non-9 elements from the grid (i.e., replace them with 0). This can be done by iterating through the grid and checking each cell's value. If the value is not a 9, replace it with 0. For example, in the input [4, 11], it becomes [4, 0].

Applying these rules to the last input grid:

Input:
