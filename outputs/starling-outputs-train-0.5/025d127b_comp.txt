Here's the reasoning behind the transformation rules for each case:

Case 0:
- The grid consists of two distinct objects (6 and 2).
- Object 6 is connected horizontally and vertically, while object 2 is connected only horizontally.
- There are no tasks involving counting, sorting, or physical contact between objects.
- The transformation rule is to keep the same structure of connected objects but remove any noise or occlusion by setting all background values (0) to 0.

Case 1:
- The grid consists of a single object with value 8 connected horizontally and vertically.
- There are no tasks involving counting, sorting, or physical contact between objects.
- The transformation rule is to keep the same structure of the connected object but remove any noise or occlusion by setting all background values (0) to 0.

Case 2:
- The grid consists of a single object with value 4 connected horizontally and vertically.
- There are no tasks involving counting, sorting, or physical contact between objects.
- The transformation rule is to keep the same structure of the connected object but remove any noise or occlusion by setting all background values (0) to 0.

Based on these reasoning and transformation rules, here's the output for the last input grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
