After analyzing the given cases and applying the transformation rules, I have determined that the correct output for the last input grid (Case 3) should be as follows:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the transformation rule is to keep the objects with the same number adjacent to each other and remove any noise or occlusion. The output grid retains the objects with numbers 2 and 3, while the background remains as 0.
