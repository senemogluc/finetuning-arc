Case 2:

To generate the output grid for the given input, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships. In this case, there are two objects: one with value 3 and another with value 2. They are adjacent to each other horizontally.
2. Apply the transformation rule that same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object. The 3s and 2s will merge into a single object, forming a "V" shape.
3. Count the number of objects in the output grid. There are three distinct objects: the merged "V"-shaped object, the background (0), and the remaining 3.
4. Arrange the objects according to their positions in the input grid. The merged "V"-shaped object will be placed at the top left corner of the output grid, the remaining 3 will be at the bottom right corner, and the background will fill the rest of the grid.
5. Check if the transformation rule works on previous input-output pairs. It does not apply to Case 0 and Case 1, but it is consistent with the given rules.

Output:

  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3]
  [0, 2, 3]
