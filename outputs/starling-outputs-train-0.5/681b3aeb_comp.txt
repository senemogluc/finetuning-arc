Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, I will infer the transformation rule for the last input grid:

In this case, we can see that the numbers are arranged in a grid pattern with increasing values along rows and columns. The numbers seem to be part of vertical or horizontal lines, with the same number repeating multiple times on each line. This suggests that the transformation rule involves recognizing these patterns and arranging them accordingly.

Here's my reasoning for this case:

1. Observe the input grid and identify the patterns (increasing values along rows and columns).
2. Recognize that the same number repeats multiple times on each line, indicating a pattern.
3. Apply the transformation rule to arrange the numbers based on these patterns.
4. Check whether the transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs.

Now, I will apply the transformation rule to the last input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's the reasoning for this case:

1. Observe the input grid and identify the patterns (increasing values along rows and columns).
2. Recognize that the same number repeats multiple times on each line, indicating a pattern.
3. Apply the transformation rule to arrange the numbers based on these patterns. In this case, we can rearrange the grid so that the increasing values along rows and columns are more evident, and the same number repeats multiple times on each line.
4. Check whether the transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs (which it does).

This output grid corresponds to the last given input grid using the inferred transformation rule.
