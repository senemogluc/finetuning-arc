To find the output grid for the given input grid, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships in the input grid. In this case, we have three objects with values 0, 1, and 2. The object with value 0 is a background, so it doesn't affect the transformations. Objects with values 1 and 2 are adjacent to each other, so they form a single object.
2. Apply counting or basic arithmetic if necessary. In this case, there are no numerical aspects involved in the transformation.
3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts. In this case, we can observe that the object with value 1 is not connected to the object with value 2. Therefore, they should be separated in the output grid.
4. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the objects with values 1 and 2 should be separated in the output grid.
5. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs. The transformation works correctly for all three cases provided earlier.

Based on these steps, the output grid for the given input is:

  [0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 1]
