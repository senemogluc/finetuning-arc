In this case, we have a 3x3 grid with three different numbers (1, 2, and 0). We can observe that each number forms a separate object in the grid. The transformation rule implies that objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. Therefore, the output should maintain these objects while considering their relationships, transformations, and intentions guiding the transformations.

To create the output grid, we can merge the adjacent objects of the same number:

1. Merge the 1's: [1, 0, 0] -> [1, 0, 0]
2. Merge the 2's: [0, 2, 1] -> [0, 2, 1] and [1, 2, 0] -> [1, 2, 0]
3. The 0 is already isolated in the grid.

Now, we can arrange these merged objects in a grid:

Output:
  [1, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 1]
  [1, 2, 0]

This output maintains the relationships and transformations of the input grid while minimizing noise.
