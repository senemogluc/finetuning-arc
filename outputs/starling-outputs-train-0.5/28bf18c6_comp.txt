Case 3:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To determine the transformation rule, we can analyze the given input-output pairs. In this case, we notice that:

1. The same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object (e.g., the 3s in the input grid).
2. Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects (e.g., the 0s and 3s).
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects (e.g., count the number of 3s in the input grid).
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects (e.g., sum up the occurrences of a specific number).
5. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is to count the occurrences of each number in the input grid and place them in the output grid accordingly. In this case, there are two 3s in the input grid: one in the 5th row and another in the 6th row. Therefore, the output grid should be:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

However, it's important to note that the given input-output pairs might not provide enough information to derive a specific transformation rule. In such cases, we can only suggest general guidelines that may help in transforming the input grid based on the provided rules and reasoning.
