Here's a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning for the transformation rule and the output grid:

1. Identify the same numbers that are adjacent to each other in the input grid, which form objects. In this case, we have:
   - Object 1: [0, 8, 0] (top left corner)
   - Object 2: [0, 0, 0] (empty space)
   - Object 3: [0, 0, 0] (empty space)

2. Apply the transformation rule to each object and place them in the output grid. We'll shift each object horizontally by one position to the right:

   - Shifted Object 1: [0, 8, 0] -> [5, 8, 0]

   - Shifted Object 2: [0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0] (no change)

   - Shifted Object 3: [0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0] (no change)

3. Place the shifted objects in the output grid, maintaining their relative positions from the input grid:

   Output Grid:
   
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the output grid is smaller than the input grid.
