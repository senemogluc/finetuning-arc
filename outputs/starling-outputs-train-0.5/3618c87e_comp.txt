Here's the reasoning process for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, there are no instances of physical contact between objects. The main task here is to recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. Based on these concepts, the output grid can be derived by moving the object with value 1 from the input grid to an adjacent position where it doesn't overlap with the object with value 5.

Case 1:
The transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, there are instances of physical contact between objects. The main task here is to recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. Based on these concepts, the output grid can be derived by moving the object with value 1 from the input grid to an adjacent position where it doesn't overlap with the object with value 5.

Case 2:
The transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, there are instances of physical contact between objects. The main task here is to recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. Based on these concepts, the output grid can be derived by moving the object with value 1 from the input grid to an adjacent position where it doesn't overlap with the object with value 5.

Case 3:
The transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, there are instances of physical contact between objects. The main task here is to recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. Based on these concepts, the output grid can be derived by moving the object with value 1 from the input grid to an adjacent position where it doesn't overlap with the object with value 5.

For the last input (Case 3), following the same reasoning process as in Case 0, 1, and 2, we can derive the output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 5]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

This is the output grid for the last input case.
