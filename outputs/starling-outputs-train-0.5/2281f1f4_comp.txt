To determine the transformation rule, we can analyze the patterns in the given cases. In each case, there are two types of objects: those with a single number (e.g., 5) and those with two numbers (e.g., 2, 2). The single-number objects seem to be centered around an empty space (0), while the double-number objects have one number on each side of an empty space.

From this observation, we can infer that the transformation rule involves moving the objects horizontally by one position and filling in the gaps with the corresponding numbers. In other words, the output grid will be the result of shifting all the objects one step to the right while maintaining the same structure.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the last input:

Input:
  [5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]

Applying the transformation rule:

Output:
  [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

So, the output of the last input is:

  [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
