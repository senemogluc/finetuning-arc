Here's the reasoning for each option and the chosen one:

Option 1:
- This option doesn't take into account the presence of the number 3 in the grid, which might indicate a specific object.
- The grid is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise, but it doesn't seem to have any significant meaning or pattern in terms of object relationships and persistence.
- Selected because it maintains the shape and size of the original objects, but it doesn't consider the presence of the number 3 as a potential indicator for an object.

Option 2:
- This option focuses on the horizontal and vertical alignments of the numbers in the grid, assuming that adjacent numbers with the same value are part of the same object.
- It separates objects based on their values (e.g., all 0s, all 1s), but it doesn't consider the presence of the number 3 as a potential indicator for an object.
- Selected because it maintains the shape and size of the original objects while taking into account the alignment of numbers with the same value.

Option 3:
- This option focuses on the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal alignments of the numbers in the grid, considering that adjacent numbers with the same value are part of the same object.
- It takes into account the presence of the number 3 as a potential indicator for an object, recognizing that it might be part of a specific object (e.g., the top-left corner object).
- Selected because it maintains the shape and size of the original objects while considering the alignment of numbers with the same value and the presence of the number 3 as a potential indicator for an object.

Here's the output grid based on Option 3:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this output grid, the objects are separated based on their values (e.g., all 0s, all 1s), and the presence of the number 3 as a potential indicator for an object is taken into account.
