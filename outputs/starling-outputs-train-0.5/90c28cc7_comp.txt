Here's a step-by-step analysis of the transformation rules and reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [2, 8]
  [1, 4]

In this case, the transformation rule is based on recognizing and grouping objects with the same values adjacent to each other. The output grid will have only these grouped objects in their original positions.

Case 1:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [2, 8]
  [1, 4]

In this case, the transformation rule is based on recognizing and grouping objects with the same values adjacent to each other. The output grid will have only these grouped objects in their original positions.

Case 2:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
