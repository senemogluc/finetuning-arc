To generate the output grid for the given input grid, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, there are two main objects - one with value 8 and another with value 0 (background). The 8s are arranged in a square shape, with two rows of three 8s each.
2. Apply counting or basic arithmetic: Count the number of 8s in the input grid. There are six 8s in total. Divide them equally among the four positions they occupy in the grid.
3. Transform objects based on their relationships and persistence: Since the 8s are arranged in a square shape, we can divide them equally among the positions they occupy. For each position with an 8, replace it with two 2s.
4. Ensure that the transformation works for previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule we induced from previous cases is consistent and applicable to this case as well.

Following these steps, the output grid would be:
```less
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
