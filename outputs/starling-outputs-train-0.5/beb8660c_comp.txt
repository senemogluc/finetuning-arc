Based on the provided transformation rules and previous cases, I will generate the output grid for the given input grid.

Input:
  [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Output:
  [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. The 6s in the first row are part of the same object, so they are kept together and maintain their positions.
2. The 1s in the second row are part of a separate object, which moves to the left side of the grid.
3. The 4s in the fourth row form another object that remains mostly unchanged but has its position adjusted to be next to the 9.
4. The 7s in the sixth row and the 9 in the ninth row are part of a separate object, which moves to the right side of the grid.
5. The 2s in the eighth row form another object that maintains its position but has its shape adjusted to fit the available space.
6. The 8s in the last two rows are part of a single object that remains unchanged, except for the position of one 8, which moves to the left side of the grid to be adjacent to the other 8s.
