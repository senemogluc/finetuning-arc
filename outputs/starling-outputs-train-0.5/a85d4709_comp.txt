To find the output grid for the given input grid, we can analyze the relationships between objects and their transformations. 

Here's the input grid:

```
[0, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0]
[0, 5, 0]
```

We can see that there are three distinct objects in this grid:

1. The object with value 0 at positions (0, 0), (0, 2), and (2, 0). This object is not part of any other object, so it remains unchanged.
2. The object with value 5 at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2). Since these two positions are adjacent, they form a single object. They also have the same value, so they remain unchanged as well. However, their positions in the output grid will be different due to the transformation rule.
3. The object with value 0 at position (1, 0). This object is not part of any other object, but it's adjacent to the object with value 5. Since we are considering physical contact and transformations between elements, we can assume that this object is pushed by the object with value 5, resulting in a translation of one unit to the right.

Now let's apply these transformations to create the output grid:

```
[0, 3, 3]
[2, 4, 4]
[3, 2, 3]
```

The output grid for the given input is:

```
[0, 3, 3]
[2, 4, 4]
[3, 2, 3]
```
