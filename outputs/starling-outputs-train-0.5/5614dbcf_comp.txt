Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the output grid should represent the merged objects from the input grid. In this case, the main objects are formed by the numbers 3, 5, and 7. 

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the input grid:

1. Merge the objects with number 3: [3, 3, 3] becomes a single object.
2. Merge the objects with number 5: [5, 4, 4], [0, 5, 0], and [0, 0, 5] become single objects.
3. Merge the objects with number 7: [7, 5, 7], [0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 7], [9, 9, 9] become single objects.
4. The remaining object is formed by the number 8, which appears only once in the grid.

Now, let's construct the output grid:

- For the merged object with number 3, we can represent it as a single object with value 3 since all the elements are the same.
- For the merged objects with number 5, we can represent them as a single object with value 5 since all the elements are the same except for one element in the middle.
- For the merged objects with number 7, we can represent them as a single object with value 7 since all the elements are the same.
- The remaining object is formed by the number 8, which appears only once in the grid.

Considering these observations, the output grid for the last input should be:

Output:
[3]
[5]
[7]
[8]
