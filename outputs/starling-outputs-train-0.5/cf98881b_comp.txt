Based on the given transformations and priors, it's challenging to determine a unique output for the last input grid without more context or specific rules. Here are some possible outputs based on different interpretations of the given transformations:

Output 1:
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]
  [4, 4, 0, 4, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 2]
  [4, 4, 0, 2]

Output 2:
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]
  [4, 4, 0, 4, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 2]
  [4, 4, 0, 2]

Output 3:
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]
  [4, 4, 0, 4, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 2]
  [4, 4, 0, 2]

Each of these outputs represents a different interpretation of how the transformation rules may apply to the given input grid. Without more context or specific rules, it's not possible to definitively determine which output is correct.
