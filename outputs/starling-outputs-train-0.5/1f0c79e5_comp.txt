Given the transformation rules and the previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule for this case is to stack the adjacent objects with the same color vertically. The goal here seems to be to maximize the number of objects with the same color.

Here's how the transformation can be applied to the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This transformation rule also works on the previous input-output pairs, as it maintains the same structure and transforms the objects according to the rules we have inferred.
