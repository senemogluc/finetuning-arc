Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 1:
The input grid has 2x3 objects with the same numbers adjacent to each other. The transformation rule should maintain these objects and their adjacency. Therefore, the output grid will be the same as the input grid in this case.

Case 2:
In this grid, there are no identical numbers adjacent to each other. However, we can observe that there are 3x2 objects with the same number (2) and a 3x3 object with the number 3 at its center. The transformation rule should preserve these objects while maintaining their adjacency. Therefore, the output grid will be the same as the input grid in this case.

Case 3:
In this grid, we can see that all the numbers are either 0 or 3. There are no identical numbers adjacent to each other. The transformation rule should preserve these objects while maintaining their adjacency. Therefore, the output grid will be the same as the input grid in this case.

So, for both Case 1 and Case 2, the output is the same as the input:

Output:
[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
[0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2]
[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

For Case 3, the output is also the same as the input:

Output:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
