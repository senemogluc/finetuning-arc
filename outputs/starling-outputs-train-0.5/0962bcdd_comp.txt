Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid:
   - Object A: [7, 2, 7] (occurs twice)
   - Object B: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object C: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (occurs twice)

2. Apply the transformation rule to each object:
   - Object A: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise and mirror along the vertical axis.
     New position: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object B: No change, as it's already in the desired form.
   - Object C: No change, as it's already in the desired form.

3. Combine the transformed objects to create the output grid:

Output:
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
