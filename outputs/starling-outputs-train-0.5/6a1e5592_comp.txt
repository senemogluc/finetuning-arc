Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects with the same color (number) adjacent to each other. In this case, we can see that there are 5x5 squares of the same color in the input grid. For example, the first object is formed by the numbers 2, 0, and 2 in the first row.

2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can see that there are 5x5 squares of the same color, which means there are 5 groups of these objects in each grid.

3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects: In each grid, we have 5 groups of 5x5 squares, so there are a total of 5 * 5 = 25 squares in each group.

4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined: The objects are square-shaped, and they are arranged in a grid pattern.

5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: As explained above, the main transformation rule is to identify and count the objects (squares) with the same color (number).

6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation correctly identifies and counts the objects in all three cases provided.

Final Output:
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
