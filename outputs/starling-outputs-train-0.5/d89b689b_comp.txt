Based on the provided priors and reasoning, here's a possible transformation rule for each case:

Case 0:
- The objects are separated based on their colors (numbers). Each object consists of connected cells with the same number.
- The background is removed by setting its value to 0.

Case 1:
- The objects are separated based on their colors (numbers). Each object consists of connected cells with the same number.
- The background is removed by setting its value to 0.

Case 2:
- The objects are separated based on their colors (numbers). Each object consists of connected cells with the same number.
- The background is removed by setting its value to 0.
- The top-left corner object has a size of 2x3, and the bottom-right corner object has a size of 1x6. These objects are swapped in position.

Case 3:
- The objects are separated based on their colors (numbers). Each object consists of connected cells with the same number.
- The background is removed by setting its value to 0.
- The top-right corner object has a size of 1x7, and the bottom-left corner object has a size of 3x4. These objects are swapped in position.

For Case 3, here's the output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rules derived from the previous input-output pairs.
