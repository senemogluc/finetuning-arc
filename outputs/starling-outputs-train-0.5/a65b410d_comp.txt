Here are my thoughts for each case:

Case 0:
- Objects with value 2 are separated by a background (value 0).
- We can't merge objects with different values.
- The transformation rule doesn't require any counting or basic arithmetic.
- The output grid is smaller than the input grid, as we need to remove one object (2).

Case 1:
- Objects with value 2 are separated by a background (value 0).
- We can merge objects with the same value (2) and create a new object with the same value.
- The transformation rule doesn't require any counting or basic arithmetic.
- The output grid is smaller than the input grid, as we need to remove one object (2).

Case 2:
- Objects with value 2 are separated by a background (value 0).
- We can merge objects with the same value (2) and create a new object with the same value.
- The transformation rule doesn't require any counting or basic arithmetic.
- The output grid is smaller than the input grid, as we need to remove one object (2).

Case 3:
- Objects with value 2 are separated by a background (value 0).
- We can merge objects with the same value (2) and create a new object with the same value.
- The transformation rule doesn't require any counting or basic arithmetic.
- The output grid is smaller than the input grid, as we need to remove one object (2).

As there are no significant differences between the cases, I will use the transformation rule from Case 0 since it has a background value of 0, which simplifies the process:

Output Grid for Case 3:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
