To determine the transformation rule for the given cases, we can analyze the changes in each case and identify patterns. Here's a breakdown of each case:

Case 1:
- The input grid has two objects with value 4 (one on the left side and one on the right side). In the output grid, these objects are still present but have been mirrored horizontally.
- The empty spaces between these objects in the input grid have been filled with a new object with value 2.
- This case demonstrates a mirror transformation along the horizontal axis.

Case 2:
- Similar to Case 1, the two objects with value 4 are still present but mirrored horizontally.
- The empty spaces between these objects in the input grid have been filled with a new object with value 0 this time.
- This case also demonstrates a mirror transformation along the horizontal axis.

Case 3:
- In this case, there are two objects with value 4 at the top and bottom of the grid. These objects remain unchanged in the output grid.
- The empty spaces between these objects have been filled with a new object with value 0.
- This case demonstrates a mirror transformation along the vertical axis.

Based on the analysis, it's clear that the main transformation rule for all cases is a mirror transformation along either the horizontal or vertical axis. The specific axis depends on the input grid. To determine the output of the last input, we can apply the same transformation rule:

Output:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
