Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same numbers:
   - Object 1: [5, 2, 2] (adjacent to each other)
   - Object 2: [1, 6, 6] (adjacent to each other)

2. Apply transformation rules:
   - Object 1 will be transformed by adding a copy of itself horizontally and vertically:
     New grid:
       [5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2]
       [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
       [2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2]
   - Object 2 will be transformed by adding a copy of itself horizontally and vertically as well:
     New grid:
       [1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6]
       [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
       [6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6]

3. Combine the transformed objects:
   Final output grid:
     [1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2]
     [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
     [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2]
     [1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2]
