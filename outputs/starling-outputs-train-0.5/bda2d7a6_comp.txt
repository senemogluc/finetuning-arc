Here's my reasoning for each case:

Case 0: The input grid consists of a single object with value 3. The transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects and persistence of objects. In this case, there is no interaction or change in the object's form or position. Therefore, the output grid should be the same as the input grid, with all values set to 0.

Case 1: The input grid consists of a single object with value 7. Again, there are no interactions or changes in the object's form or position. Thus, the output grid should be the same as the input grid, but with all values set to 6.

Case 2: The input grid consists of a single object with value 8. There is no interaction between objects, and the object itself does not change in any way. Therefore, the output grid should be the same as the input grid, but with all values set to 5.

Case 3: The input grid consists of a single object with value 9. Similar to previous cases, there are no interactions or changes in the object's form or position. Thus, the output grid should be the same as the input grid, but with all values set to 1.

Based on this reasoning, the output for the last input (Case 3) should be:

  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]
  [1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  [1, 9, 0, 9, 9, 1]
  [1, 9, 0, 9, 9, 1]
  [1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  [1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
