Based on the provided cases and priors, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies universally. However, I can provide an analysis for each case separately:

Case 0: In this case, the grid seems to have no interaction between objects or any specific pattern. The output is simply an enlarged version of the input with all 2's and 8's preserved. 

Case 1: Here, there are two different numbers (2 and 3) present in a 3x3 grid. The output grid seems to be a larger version of the input grid, with each object (group of same-numbered cells) being duplicated horizontally to form a longer row.

Case 2: In this case, there are two different numbers (1 and 2) present in a 4x3 grid. The output grid is an enlarged version of the input grid, with each object (group of same-numbered cells) being duplicated horizontally to form longer rows.

Case 3: Here, there are two different numbers (0 and 3) present in a 3x4 grid. The output grid seems to be an enlarged version of the input grid, with each object (group of same-numbered cells) being duplicated horizontally to form longer rows.

To provide an output for the last input, we can use the pattern observed in Case 1:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1]
  [3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
