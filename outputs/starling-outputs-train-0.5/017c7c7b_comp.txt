Based on the provided input and transformation rules from previous cases, we can infer the following transformation rule for this case:

1. Identify objects by grouping adjacent same-valued cells (same numbers).
2. Count the number of occurrences of each object in the grid.
3. Double the count of each object and assign the doubled value to all the cells belonging to that object.
4. If an object is not present in a row or column, fill it with 0.
5. Ensure the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

For the last input:

Input:
  [1, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 0]
  [1, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 0]

Objects:
- Object 1: [1, 1, 1] (3 instances)
- Object 2: [0, 1, 0] (2 instances)

Doubled count and assigned values:
- Object 1: [2, 2, 2] (6 instances)
- Object 2: [0, 2, 0] (4 instances)

Output grid:
  [2, 2, 2]
  [0, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 0]
  [2, 2, 2]
  [0, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 0]
