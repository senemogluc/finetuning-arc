Here's a step-by-step analysis and reasoning for the transformation rule to generate the output grid from the given input grid.

Case 3:
Input:
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

1. Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object: In this case, we can identify several objects in the input grid with the same number (e.g., [1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2]).

2. Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects: Since there is no significant noise or occlusion in this input grid, we can assume that the objects will persist in their current form.

3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: In this case, there doesn't seem to be any direct physical contact between objects in the input grid. However, we can see that some objects are connected or adjacent to each other (e.g., [1, 0, 1] and [0, 0, 2]).

4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects: In this case, there is no clear need for counting or sorting objects in the input grid. However, we can observe that some objects have a higher frequency (e.g., object [1, 1, 1] appears more than once).

5. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects: In this case, there are no significant differences in the size or shape of the objects in the input grid. The only notable difference is in the number of occurrences for each object.

Based on these observations, we can apply the following transformation rule to generate the output grid from the given input grid:

- Maintain the same number of occurrences for each object in the output grid as in the input grid.
- Replace the background with a lower value (e.g., -1) to differentiate it from the objects.
- Ensure that adjacent objects with the same number remain connected in the output grid.

Following this transformation rule, the output grid for Case 3 would be:

Output:
  [-1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [-1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  [-1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [-1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
