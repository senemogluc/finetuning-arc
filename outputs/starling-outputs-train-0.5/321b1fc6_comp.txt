Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid:
   - There are two main objects in the grid: a group of 8s (7x2) and a group of 6s (3x2).

2. Analyze object relationships, transformations, and persistence:
   - The 8s form a rectangle-like shape with dimensions 7x2. They are connected horizontally.
   - The 6s form another rectangle-like shape with dimensions 3x2. They are connected horizontally as well.

3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for numerical aspects:
   - There are 14 8s in the grid, and they are all part of the same object.
   - There are 6 6s in the grid, and they are all part of the same object.

4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts:
   - Both objects (8s and 6s) are rectangular in shape, with dimensions 7x2 and 3x2, respectively.

5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one:
   - We need to find a way to transform the input grid into an output grid that maintains the integrity of the objects while also minimizing noise or occlusion. In this case, we can keep the 8s and 6s separate in the output grid.

6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs:
   - For Case 0 and Case 1, the transformation rule maintains the integrity of the objects while minimizing noise or occlusion. The output grids are logical and coherent with the given input grids.

Based on these steps, here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
