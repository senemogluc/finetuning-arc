Here's the transformation rule I induced from the previous input-output pairs:

1. Identify objects by their adjacent numbers in the grid (same color).
2. Preserve the shape and size of the objects during transformations, even if they are partially occluded or noisy.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions.
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
5. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts.
6. Check if the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs to ensure consistency.
7. The output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the last given Input grid (Case 2):

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of the last input (Case 2) is:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
