I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here's the correct output for the last input grid:

Case 3:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:

  [0, 3, 3, 0]
  [3, 3, 5, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0]

In this case, the transformation rule involves identifying and grouping objects with the same value. The output grid shows the transformed positions of these objects while maintaining their relative arrangement in the input grid.
