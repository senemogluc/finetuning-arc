Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each option and then picking one:

Option 1:
In this case, we can observe that the 3x3 blocks with number 5 are arranged in a way that they seem to be part of a single object. The same applies to the 3x3 blocks with number 6 and number 7. Therefore, it's possible that these objects are interacting with each other in some manner. However, there is no clear indication of any transformation or persistence between the input and output grids.

Option 2:
In this case, we can observe that the numbers 4 and 5 are arranged in a way that they seem to be part of a single object. The same applies to the numbers 3 and 6. However, there is no clear indication of any transformation or persistence between the input and output grids.

Option 3:
In this case, we can observe that the numbers 5 and 6 are arranged in a way that they seem to be part of a single object. The same applies to the numbers 0 and 7. Additionally, there is a clear transformation between the input and output grids as the number 2 becomes 8, indicating an increase by 6.

Based on these observations, it seems that Option 3 provides the most consistent pattern in terms of object relationships, transformations, and persistence. Therefore, I choose this option as the correct one.

Output:

[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0]
[0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
[5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
