Here's one possible approach to solving this problem:

1. Identify and separate objects within the grid based on their values (0 or non-zero). In this case, we will consider 0 as the background.
2. For each object identified in step 1, find its neighbors horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. This can be done using a 4-connected neighborhood for objects with value 3 and an 8-connected neighborhood for all other values.
3. If any neighbor of an object has the same value as the object itself, merge them by replacing the original object's value with the sum of its value and that of its merged neighbor(s). This step ensures that objects with the same value are combined.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more merges can be made or a fixed number of iterations have been performed, indicating convergence.
5. The final grid state is the output.

For each case, we apply this approach and obtain the following outputs:
