The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing and leveraging elementary geometry and topology concepts, such as shapes, angles, and distances between objects. However, it's difficult to determine an exact transformation rule based on the given inputs and outputs alone.

Here is one possible interpretation of the transformation rule:

1. Identify groups of connected objects in the grid.
2. For each group, find the centroid (average position) of all the non-background elements within the group.
3. Replace each object in the group with a single element at its centroid position.
4. If there are multiple groups, arrange them in a row or column order, preserving their relative positions from the input grid.

Based on this interpretation, here's the output for the last input:

Output:
  [5, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5]
