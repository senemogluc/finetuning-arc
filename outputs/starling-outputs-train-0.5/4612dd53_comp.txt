Here are my thoughts on the transformation rule and reasoning for each option:

1. The main goal in this task is to identify and group objects that are adjacent to each other. This can be achieved by iterating through the grid and checking if two numbers share a side, then combining them into the same object. 

2. Another important aspect of the transformation rule is persistence. Objects should maintain their form despite noise or occlusion by other objects. This means that even if an object is partially obscured, it should still be recognized as part of the same object when it reappears.

3. The task also involves counting and sorting objects, so it's important to consider the numerical values and their relationships. For example, objects with the same number value should be merged together, while objects with different values should remain separate.

4. Elementary geometry and topology concepts can help identify how objects interact with each other. For instance, if two objects are touching at a corner, they should be considered part of the same object.

5. The transformation rule should apply consistently across all input-output pairs to ensure consistency and predictability. 

Based on these considerations, I have derived a transformation rule that involves merging adjacent objects with the same number value while preserving their form despite noise or occlusion. Here's the reasoning for each option:

Case 0:
Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation rule is applied consistently across all input-output pairs. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and maintains the object relationships, transformations, and persistence.

Case 1:
Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation rule is applied consistently across all input-output pairs. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and maintains the object relationships, transformations, and persistence.

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
