Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case and the final output grid:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to be based on adding values in adjacent cells. The numbers in the input grids are increasing from left to right and top to bottom, forming a spiral pattern. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and is generated by adding the corresponding values of each cell in the input grid:

Output:
  [16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16]
  [16, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 16]
  [16, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 16]
  [16, 9, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 16]
  [16, 9, 8, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 16]
  [16, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 16]
  [16, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 16]
  [16, 9, 8, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 16]
  [16, 9, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 16]
  [16, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16]
  [16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16]

Case 1:
The transformation rule is not immediately apparent. However, we can notice that the input grid has a repeating pattern of two rows with different values for each row. The output grid is formed by mirroring the input grid horizontally and adjusting the values accordingly:

Output:
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6]
  [6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 6]
  [6, 1, 2, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 1, 2, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Case 2:
The transformation rule is not immediately apparent. However, we can notice that the input grid has a repeating pattern of two rows with different values for each row. The output grid is formed by mirroring the input grid horizontally and adjusting the values accordingly:

Output:
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]
  [4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
  [4, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2]
  [4, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2]
  [4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
  [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Case 3:
The transformation rule is not immediately apparent. However, we can notice that the input grid has a repeating pattern of two rows with different values for each row. The output grid is formed by mirroring the input grid horizontally and adjusting the values accordingly:

Output:
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]
  [3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3]
  [3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3]
  [3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 7, 2, 4, 1, 3]
  [3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 7, 2, 4, 1, 3]
  [3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3]
  [3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3]
  [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Case 4:
The transformation rule is not immediately apparent. However, we can notice that the input grid has a repeating pattern of two rows with different values for each row. The output grid is formed by mirroring the input grid horizontally and adjusting the values accordingly:

Output:
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]
  [8, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 8]
  [8, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 8]
  [8, 2, 4, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 4, 8]
