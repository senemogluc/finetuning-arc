Here's a step-by-step analysis and reasoning process for each case:

Case 0:
The main objects in this grid are 2x2 squares with values 1, 2. There are no clear transformations or persistence rules to apply. The output grid is the same as the input grid.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Case 1:
The main objects in this grid are 2x3 squares with values 0, 1, and 2. There are no clear transformations or persistence rules to apply. The output grid is the same as the input grid.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
The main objects in this grid are 3x3 squares with values 1 and 2. There are no clear transformations or persistence rules to apply. The output grid is the same as the input grid.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 3:
The main objects in this grid are 2x2 squares with values 1 and 2. The only clear transformation rule is that the value 0 is a background color for each object. There are no other transformations or persistence rules to apply. The output grid is the same as the input grid.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0
