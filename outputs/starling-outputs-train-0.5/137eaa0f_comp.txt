Here's a possible transformation rule for the given cases:

1. Identify and group objects with the same number together. If two adjacent numbers are part of different groups, check if they can be combined based on their relationship (e.g., if one is larger than the other). If so, combine them into a single object. Otherwise, leave them as separate objects.
2. Translate and rotate objects to align with each other if necessary, based on their relationships or intentions guiding the transformations.
3. Count the number of objects in the input grid and create an output grid with the same dimensions. Assign a value to each cell in the output grid based on the transformed objects from the input grid.
4. If there are no objects in the input grid, the output grid can be empty or have a single background object (value 0).

Applying this rule to the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [6, 5, 4]
  [9, 9, 8]
  [3, 7, 3]

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation process:

1. Identify and group objects with the same number together. In this case, we have two groups of 9s, one group of 5s, one group of 4s, one group of 2s, and no groups of 0s or 6s. The 9s can be combined into a single object since they are the same number.
2. Translate and rotate objects to align with each other if necessary. In this case, there's no need for translation or rotation as all the objects are already aligned.
3. Count the number of objects in the input grid and create an output grid with the same dimensions. We have 9 objects in total (6 9s, 2 5s, 1 4). Create a 12x12 output grid to accommodate these objects.
4. Assign a value to each cell in the output grid based on the transformed objects from the input grid:
   - For the combined 9s object, assign a value of 3 (since there are 3 groups of 9s).
   - For the 5s object, assign a value of 7 (since there are 2 groups of 5s).
   - For the 4s object, assign a value of 4.
   - For the 2s object, assign a value of 2.

As a result, the output grid is:

  [6, 5, 4]
  [9, 9, 8]
  [3, 7, 3]
