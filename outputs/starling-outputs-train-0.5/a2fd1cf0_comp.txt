Based on the provided input and previous cases, it seems that the transformation rule involves moving objects with the same number adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically. Here's an analysis of the last input case:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Applying the transformation rule from previous cases:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
