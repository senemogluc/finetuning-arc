To determine the transformation rule, we can look at the previous cases and identify common patterns or goals. In these cases, we can observe that objects with the same number are being grouped together, and the grid is transformed to show the relationships between these objects.

For Case 3, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Group objects with the same number together.
2. Count the number of occurrences of each object.
3. Arrange the objects based on their count in a grid.

Using this rule for the last input:

Input:
  [0, 5, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 8]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid shows the relationships between objects with the same number, grouping them together and counting their occurrences.
