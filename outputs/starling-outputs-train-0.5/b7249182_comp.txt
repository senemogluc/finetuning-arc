Here's my reasoning for each option and then I will pick one:

1. In Case 0, there are no objects with adjacent same numbers. The transformation rule doesn't seem to apply here.
2. In Case 1, we have objects with adjacent same numbers (3 and 1). We can group them together and transform the output grid accordingly. The transformation rule applies here.
3. In Case 2, we have a similar situation as in Case 1, but with an additional object (8). The transformation rule still applies.
4. In Case 3, there are no objects with adjacent same numbers. The transformation rule doesn't seem to apply here.

Based on the reasoning above, I will choose Case 1 as it is the most suitable for applying the transformation rule. Here's the output grid for the last input in Case 1:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
