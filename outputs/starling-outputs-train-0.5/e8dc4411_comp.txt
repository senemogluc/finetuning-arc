Based on the provided transformations and priors, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the given input. The transformation rules are not specific enough to create a clear output grid from the input grid. 

Here are two possible outputs based on different interpretations of the rules:

Output 1:
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Please note that these outputs are based on assumptions and interpretations of the given rules. The actual output may vary depending on the intended transformation rule.
