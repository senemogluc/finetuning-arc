Here's the reasoning for the last input-output pair:

The grid has a structure where there are two types of objects: horizontal and vertical stripes. The horizontal stripes consist of alternating 1s and 8s, while the vertical stripes are formed by 6s.

In the first row, we have a horizontal stripe consisting of 8s and 1s. We can transform it into a vertical stripe by replacing every other element with a 6. This gives us:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The second row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The third row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The fourth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The fifth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The sixth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The seventh row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The eighth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The ninth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The tenth row is a horizontal stripe consisting of alternating 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a vertical stripe by replacing every other element with a 6:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The eleventh row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The twelfth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The thirteenth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The fourteenth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The fifteenth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The sixteenth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The seventeenth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The eighteenth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The nineteenth row is a vertical stripe consisting of 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a horizontal stripe by replacing every other element with an 8:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The twentieth row is a horizontal stripe consisting of alternating 1s and 8s. We can transform it into a vertical stripe by replacing every other element with a 6:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The output grid for the last input is:
