Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation process for the last input grid:

1. Identify adjacent same-colored objects and group them together:
   - In the first row, we have three groups of 2's, two groups of 0's, and one group of 2's in the middle. We can represent these as (2, 3), (0, 2), and (2, 1) respectively.
   - In the second row, we have a single group of 2's, two groups of 0's, and one group of 2's in the middle. We can represent these as (2, 1), (0, 2), and (2, 3) respectively.
   - In the third row, we have a single group of 2's, two groups of 0's, and one group of 2's in the middle. We can represent these as (2, 1), (0, 2), and (2, 3) respectively.

2. Check for any potential transformations or persistence:
   - There are no apparent physical interactions between objects, so we can assume that each group of objects maintains its original shape and size.

3. Apply the transformation rule to generate the output grid:
   - Based on the identified groups from step 1, we can create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling in the corresponding values for each group:
     Output Grid:
       [(2, 3), (0, 2), (2, 1), (0, 2), (2, 3), (0, 2), (2, 3), (0, 2), (2, 3), (0, 2), (2, 3)]

The output of the last input grid is:
  [(2, 3), (0, 2), (2, 1), (0, 2), (2, 3), (0, 2), (2, 3), (0, 2), (2, 3), (0, 2), (2, 3)]
