Here's the reasoning for each step and then the final output grid:

1. The first row has all zeros, so we can keep it as is.
2. In the second row, there are three 3's in a row, so we can merge them into one object with a size of 3x1. This creates an empty space at the end of the row that we can fill later. The transformed grid becomes:
   [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ... (rest of the grid remains unchanged)

3. In the third row, there are three 3's in a row, so we can merge them into one object with a size of 3x1. This creates an empty space at the end of the row that we can fill later. The transformed grid becomes:
   [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ... (rest of the grid remains unchanged)

4. In the fourth row, there are three 3's in a column, so we can merge them into one object with a size of 1x3. This creates an empty space at the beginning and end of the row that we can fill later. The transformed grid becomes:
   [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ... (rest of the grid remains unchanged)

5. In the fifth row, there are three 3's in a column, so we can merge them into one object with a size of 1x3. This creates an empty space at the beginning and end of the row that we can fill later. The transformed grid becomes:
   [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ... (rest of the grid remains unchanged)

6. In the sixth row, there are three 3's in a column, so we can merge them into one object with a size of 1x3. This creates an empty space at the beginning and end of the row that we can fill later. The transformed grid becomes:
   [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ... (rest of the grid remains unchanged)

7. In the seventh row, there are three 3's in a column, so we can merge them into one object with a size of 1x3. This creates an empty space at the beginning and end of the row that we can fill later. The transformed grid becomes:
   [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ... (rest of the grid remains unchanged)

8. In the eighth row, there are three 3's in a column, so we can merge them into one object with a size of 1x3. This creates an empty space at the beginning and end of the row that we can fill later. The transformed grid becomes:
   [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ... (rest of the grid remains unchanged)

9. In the ninth row, there are three 3's in a column, so we can merge them into one object with a size of 1x3. This creates an empty space at the beginning and end of the row that we can fill later. The transformed grid becomes:
   [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

   ... (rest of the grid remains unchanged)

10. In the tenth row, there are three 3's in a column, so we can merge them into one object with a size of 1x3. This creates an empty space at the beginning and end of the row that we can fill later. The transformed grid becomes:
