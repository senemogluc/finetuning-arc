To determine the transformation rule for the given cases, we can analyze the patterns and relationships between the input and output pairs. Here's an analysis of each case:

1. Case 0: The output grid has all zeroes except for the top-left corner, which has a value of 5. This could be interpreted as a transformation that converts all non-zero values to zero, while keeping the top-left corner with a value of 5.
2. Case 1: The output grid has all zeroes except for the bottom-right corner, which has a value of 5. Similar to Case 0, this transformation converts all non-zero values to zero and keeps one specific value in the output.
3. Case 2: This case is similar to Case 1, but with two corners having a value of 5 instead of just one. The transformation rule still involves converting all non-zero values to zero, but now it retains more than one specific value in the output.
4. Case 3: In this case, the output grid has all zeroes except for the bottom-right corner, which has a value of 5. This is similar to Cases 0 and 1, where the transformation converts all non-zero values to zero but retains one specific value in the output.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following transformation rule:

1. Convert all non-zero values to zero.
2. Retain a specific number of specific values (one or more) in the output grid, depending on the input. These retained values will be located at the corners of the grid.

Now let's apply this rule to the last given input:

Input:
  [4, 4, 4]
  [3, 2, 3]
  [8, 8, 8]

Using the transformation rule, we convert all non-zero values to zero:

  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]

Now, we need to determine which specific corner(s) to retain. Since there are three corners with the same value (4 or 8), we can choose any one of them to be retained in the output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0] (retaining top-left corner)
  
Alternatively, we could retain a different corner, such as the bottom-right corner:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5] (retaining bottom-right corner)

Both of these outputs are valid based on the induced transformation rule and the given cases.
