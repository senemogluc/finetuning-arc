Here's the reasoning for each option and the chosen output grid for Case 4:

Option 1:
- Transform adjacent objects with the same color to form a single object.
- Count the number of objects in each row and column, and place them in the output grid accordingly.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Option 2:
- Merge objects with the same color that are adjacent horizontally or vertically.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Option 3:
- Merge objects with the same color that are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
- Count the number of objects in each row and column, and place them in the output grid accordingly.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Option 4:
- Treat each object as a single entity based on the priors.
- Merge objects with the same color that are adjacent horizontally or vertically.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the reasoning above, I choose Option 4 as the output grid for Case 4:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
