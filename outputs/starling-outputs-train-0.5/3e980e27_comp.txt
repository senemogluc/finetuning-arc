Here are the steps to transform the last input grid (Case 4) using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs:

1. Identify and group the same numbers that are adjacent to each other in the input grid. In this case, we can identify three groups: {(0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3)}, {(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0)}, and {(3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}.
2. For each group, find the centroid of the group by calculating the average x-coordinate and the average y-coordinate. Then, create a new grid with these centroids as the positions for the objects in the group. In this case:
   - Group 1: Centroid (0.5, 2)
   - Group 2: Centroid (1.5, 0.5)
   - Group 3: Centroid (3.5, 2.33)
3. Place the objects from each group at their respective centroids in the new grid. The output grid will be:

  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid for the last input (Case 4) is:

  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This is the output grid for the last input (Case 4) using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs.
