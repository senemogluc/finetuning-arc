Here are my reasoning steps for each case:

Case 0:
- The grid seems to be made up of horizontal rows of numbers. The transformation rule implies that adjacent same numbers should be part of the same object, and they persist despite noise or occlusion. The output grid should have the same structure as the input grid, but with only the numbers that appear more than once. 
- Following this reasoning, the output grid for Case 0 would be:
  [6]
  [0, 6]

Case 1:
- The grid seems to consist of two horizontal rows of the same number (4). The transformation rule implies that adjacent same numbers should be part of the same object, and they persist despite noise or occlusion. 
- Following this reasoning, the output grid for Case 1 would be:
  [4, 4]
  [4, 4]

Case 2:
- The grid seems to consist of two horizontal rows of the same number (3). The transformation rule implies that adjacent same numbers should be part of the same object, and they persist despite noise or occlusion. 
- Following this reasoning, the output grid for Case 2 would be:
  [5, 0, 0, 5]
  [5, 5, 5, 5]

Case 3:
- The grid seems to consist of a single horizontal row of the same number (9). The transformation rule implies that adjacent same numbers should be part of the same object, and they persist despite noise or occlusion. 
- Following this reasoning, the output grid for Case 3 would be:
  [9]
  [0, 4, 4, 4]

However, it appears there's a mistake in the provided output for Case 3. The correct output should be:

  [9]
  [9, 9, 9, 9]
