Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The grid seems to represent a 3x3 square with 2's on its edges and 4's in the center. The transformation rule is to group all adjacent 2's and form a single object with the central 4 at the center of the square. This results in a 3x3 square with 4's along the edges.

Case 1:
The grid seems to represent two 1x3 squares, one with 1's on its edges and another with 3's. The transformation rule is to group all adjacent objects and form a single object. This results in a 3x1 rectangle with 3's along the edge.

Case 2:
The grid seems to represent a 5x6 rectangle with 4's on its edges, except for the top-right corner which has a 6. The transformation rule is to group all adjacent objects and form a single object. This results in a 5x6 rectangle with 6's along the edges, including the top-right corner.

Case 3:
The grid seems to represent a 3x3 square with 3's on its edges, surrounded by a 5x6 rectangle with 8's along its edges. The transformation rule is to group all adjacent objects and form a single object. This results in a 5x6 rectangle with 8's along the edges, including the top-right corner.

Based on the reasoning above, here's the output for the last input grid (Case 3):

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
