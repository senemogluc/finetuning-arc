Here's the reasoning for each step and then the final result:

1. Analyze the input grids and identify objects (adjacent numbers) that are part of the same object, considering their adjacency and persistence. In this case, we have several adjacent number pairs like (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4).

2. Transform the grid based on the identified objects. For example, transform the (2, 2) pair into a single object by merging them horizontally:
   Input:
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
   Output:
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

3. Repeat step 2 for all identified objects, such as (3, 3) and (4, 4). For example:
   Input:
     [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
   Output:
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

4. Combine all the transformed grids to form the final output grid:
   Final Output:
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

So, the output of the last input grid is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
