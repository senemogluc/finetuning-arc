Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. The first step is to identify objects that are adjacent to each other and have the same number. In the given grid, we can see that:
   - 0, 3, and 7 form an object.
   - 0, 5, and 9 form an object.
   - 0, 2, and 4 form an object.
   However, the number 8 is not part of any adjacent objects. So, we can start by merging these objects:

   [0, 3, 7, 0, 5, 9, 0, 2, 4]

   Here, the numbers 3, 5, and 7 are combined into a single object, as well as the numbers 2 and 4. The number 8 is left unchanged.

2. Next, we need to consider the objects that have the same number in them. In this case, we have two objects with the number 3:
   - [0, 3] and [3]
   - [0, 7] and [7]
   - [0, 5] and [5]

   We can merge these pairs of objects into a single object:

   [0, 3, 7, 0, 5, 9, 0, 2, 4], [3, 7], [5, 9]

3. Now, we have three objects with the same number in them. We can merge these objects as well:

   [0, 3, 7, 0, 5, 9, 0, 2, 4], [3, 7], [5, 9]

4. Finally, we have two objects with the same number in them. We can merge these objects into a single object:

   [0, 3, 7, 0, 5, 9, 0, 2, 4], [3, 7], [5, 9]

Now, let's apply the transformation rule to obtain the output grid. Since all objects have been merged and there are no more adjacent objects with the same number, we can conclude that the output grid is the same as the input grid:

Output:
  [0, 3, 7, 0, 5, 9, 0, 2, 4], [3, 7], [5, 9]
