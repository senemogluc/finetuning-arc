After analyzing the given transformation rules and considering the priors, I can infer that the main focus of these tasks is to identify objects based on their adjacency in the grid and recognize transformations between the input and output grids. 

For Case 2, it seems like the input grid has a pattern where numbers are increasing by one or staying constant while moving horizontally and decreasing by one while moving vertically. 

To generate the output grid for the last given input, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects based on their adjacency in the grid. In this case, we have four objects: {7, 1}, {7, 1, 3}, {7, 1, 4}, and {1}.
2. Recognize the transformation pattern between input and output grids. The pattern is that each object moves one step to the right and its last number decreases by one. 
3. Apply the transformation pattern to each object in the input grid:
   - For the first object ({7, 1}), it moves one step to the right (becomes {7, 1}) and its last number decreases by one (becomes {6, 0}). So, it becomes {7, 1, 6, 0}.
   - For the second object ({7, 1, 3}), it moves one step to the right (becomes {7, 1, 3}) and its last number decreases by one (becomes {6, 2}). So, it becomes {7, 1, 3, 6, 2}.
   - For the third object ({7, 1, 4}), it moves one step to the right (becomes {7, 1, 4}) and its last number decreases by one (becomes {6, 3}). So, it becomes {7, 1, 4, 6, 3}.
   - For the fourth object ({1}), it moves one step to the right (becomes {1}) and its last number decreases by one (becomes {0}). So, it becomes {1, 0}.
4. Combine all transformed objects to form the output grid:

Output:
  [7, 1, 6, 0]
  [7, 1, 3, 6, 2]
  [7, 1, 4, 6, 3]
  [1, 0]
