Case 3
Input:
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]

To find the output grid, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: There are three distinct objects in this input grid - one with value 1 (top-left), another with value 2 (middle-right), and a third object with value 4 (bottom-center). These objects have no direct physical contact, so they can be transformed independently.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: The object with value 1 has three occurrences, while the object with value 2 has four occurrences. The object with value 4 appears twice. We can use these counts to determine the arrangement of these objects in the output grid.
3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: Since the objects have no direct physical contact, we can arrange them in a way that maximizes their overlap with each other. In this case, we can place the object with value 1 in the top-left corner of the output grid, the object with value 2 in the middle section, and the object with value 4 in the bottom-right corner.
4. Apply the transformation rule: Based on the arrangement determined in step 3, the output grid would look like this:

Output:
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]

So, the output grid for the last input is:

  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
