Here are my thoughts on the transformation rule for each case:

Case 0:
- Objects with value 5 seem to be part of a larger object that spans multiple rows and columns. The background (value 0) separates these objects.
- The transformation seems to involve rotating or rearranging the 5s in some pattern.
- The goal is to create an output grid where each object with value 5 is transformed into a single row, with the remaining cells being filled with zeros.

Case 1:

Case 2:
- Objects with value 5 seem to be part of a larger object that spans multiple rows and columns. The background (value 0) separates these objects.
- The transformation seems to involve rotating or rearranging the 5s in some pattern.
- The goal is to create an output grid where each object with value 5 is transformed into a single row, with the remaining cells being filled with zeros.

Based on the analysis of the cases and the given input for Case 2:

Input:
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Output:

  [1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1]
