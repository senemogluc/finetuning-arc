Here's my reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the same numbers that are adjacent to each other and group them together as objects.
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation or rebounding. In this case, there is no apparent physical contact between the objects.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. The input grid has 9 objects with values from 5 to 8. There are also 2 background (value 0) objects in each row.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. In this case, the objects are rectangular in shape.
5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one. The main goal here is to transform the input grid based on the given priors.
6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs. It seems that the transformation rule has been consistent across all cases.
7. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid. In this case, the output grid is the same size as the input grid.

Based on these steps and reasoning, here's the output for the last input:

  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
