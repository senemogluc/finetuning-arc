To determine the output grid for the given input grid, let's analyze the input-output pairs and the transformation rule.

Case 0:
Here, we can see that there are two objects with the same number adjacent to each other (1 and 3). These objects persist in the output grid, often in a transformed form. The goal seems to be recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, the transformation is simply replicating the input grid horizontally.

Case 1:
Similar to Case 0, we can see that there are two objects with the same number adjacent to each other (8 and 3). These objects persist in the output grid, often in a transformed form. The goal is still recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, the transformation is replicating the input grid vertically.

Case 2:
Here, we can see that there are two objects with the same number adjacent to each other (1 and 4). These objects persist in the output grid, often in a transformed form. The goal seems to be recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, the transformation is replicating the input grid horizontally.

Case 3:
In this case, we can see that there are two objects with the same number adjacent to each other (1 and 4). These objects persist in the output grid, often in a transformed form. The goal seems to be recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. However, unlike previous cases, there is no clear horizontal or vertical replication pattern.

Based on the analysis of the previous input-output pairs, we can infer that the transformation rule is related to recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects and replicating the grid horizontally or vertically. Since the last case does not have a clear pattern for horizontal or vertical replication, it is difficult to determine the exact output grid without more information or context.
