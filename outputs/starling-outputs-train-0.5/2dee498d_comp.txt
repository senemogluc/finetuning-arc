To find the output grid for the last given input grid, we will apply the transformation rule induced from the previous cases. We are looking for object relationships, transformations, and persistence, as well as counting and basic arithmetic for numerical aspects.

Here's the input grid:

[0, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 0, 4, 4]
[2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4]
[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]
[1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2]
[1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0]

We can observe that there are horizontal and vertical lines of the same numbers adjacent to each other. For example:

- The first row has a series of 4s (0, 4, 4)
- The second row has a series of 2s (2, 2, 2)
- The third row has a series of 2s (2, 2, 2) and 0s (0, 0, 0)
- The fourth row has a series of 1s (1, 1, 1) and 2s (2, 2, 2)
- The fifth row has a series of 1s (1, 1, 1) and 2s (2, 2, 2)

Based on this observation, we can transform the grid by considering each horizontal or vertical line as an object. We can remove any noise or occlusion to make the objects more recognizable:

Output:

[0, 4, 0]
[2, 2, 2]
[0, 4, 0]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 2, 1]

This output grid represents the transformed version of the input grid according to the induced transformation rule.
