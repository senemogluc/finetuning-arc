Here's a breakdown of the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, all the 2D grids have the same size (3x3) and are filled with the same values (9 and 1). We can consider these 2D grids as objects that share a common background (0). The numbers 9 form separate objects, while the 1s also form separate objects.

2. Analyze object transformations and persistence: In each case, the objects (both 9s and 1s) maintain their relative positions to each other and remain persistent throughout the transformations. 

3. Recognize and leverage geometry and topology concepts: The grids are essentially a square lattice with all connections existing between adjacent cells. There is no significant change in the shape or topology of these grids. 

4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects: In this case, there are no specific numerical aspects to consider, as the primary goal is to recognize and leverage geometric relationships between objects.

5. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs: The transformations applied in each case consistently produce the desired output grids based on the given inputs. 

Based on these steps, here's the output for the last input grid:

[9, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
