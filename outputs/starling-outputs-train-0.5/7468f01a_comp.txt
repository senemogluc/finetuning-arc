In this case, we can observe that there are three main objects in the input grid:

1. A horizontal row of 8s with a single 1 adjacent to it (top left).
2. A vertical column of 1s with an 8 adjacent to each (middle).
3. A horizontal row of 8s with a single 1 adjacent to it (bottom right).

We can apply the following transformation rule to obtain the output grid:

1. Combine the horizontal row of 8s and the single 1 in the top left object into a single object, preserving their relative positions.
2. Merge all the vertical columns of 1s with an 8 adjacent to each into a single object, preserving their relative positions. The 8s will form a rectangle around the 1s.
3. Combine the horizontal row of 8s and the single 1 in the bottom right object into a single object, preserving their relative positions.
4. Remove any empty spaces between the objects.

Following these steps, we get the following output grid:

  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 1, 8, 8]
  [8, 1, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]

This is the output grid for the last input.
