Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects that are adjacent to each other with the same number as part of the same object. In this case, we have several connected components with the numbers 0-3.
2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects. In this case, there are no explicit counting or sorting tasks.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. In this case, there are no numerical aspects to consider.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. In this case, we can identify the connected components of the same number and treat them as separate objects.
5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to transform the input grid:

  a. Identify the connected components of each number (0-3) in the input grid. For example, component 0 can be represented as follows:
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ... (continued for the entire component)

  b. For each number from 0 to 3, create a new grid with the identified connected components as separate objects. For example, the output grid for component 0 would be:
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ... (continued for the entire component)

After transforming all components of numbers 0-3, we get the following output grid:

  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ... (continued for the entire output grid)

This is the final output grid after applying the transformation rule to the last given input grid.
