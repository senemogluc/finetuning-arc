Here are the steps I took to generate the output grid for the last given input grid using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input grid. In this case, there are four primary objects:
- Object A: [7, 0, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0]
- Object B: [7, 7, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]
- Object C: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0]
- Object D: [7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 5]

Step 2: Analyze the relationships between objects. There are two main interactions happening in this input grid:
- Object A and Object B share a common edge with the same color (7). This indicates that they might be part of the same object or have been in contact with each other.
- Object C and Object D share a common edge with the same color (0). This also indicates that they might be part of the same object or have been in contact with each other.

Step 3: Transform the objects based on their relationships. Since Object A and Object B share an edge, we can combine them into a single object by replacing the common edge with the background color (0). The resulting combined object will be:
- Combined Object AB: [7, 0, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0]

Similarly, since Object C and Object D share an edge, we can combine them into a single object by replacing the common edge with the background color (0). The resulting combined object will be:
- Combined Object CD: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0]

Step 4: Create the output grid based on the transformed objects. Since we have combined two adjacent objects in each row of the input grid, the resulting output grid will be smaller than the input grid. The output grid is as follows:

Output:
  [7, 0, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0]

So, the output of the last input grid is:

  [7, 0, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0]
