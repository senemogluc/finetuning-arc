Here's the reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The input grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 11 columns. The background color (0) is present throughout, but it doesn't form any distinct object or pattern. The remaining numbers (3-7) are arranged in a series of horizontal lines. The transformation rule seems to involve identifying the objects formed by these horizontal lines and their persistence through the transformations. 

Output:
The output grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 10 columns. Each horizontal line from the input grid is copied to the corresponding row in the output grid, preserving the original numbers and maintaining the same arrangement of objects.

Case 1:
Similar to Case 0, the input grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 11 columns. The background color (0) is present throughout but doesn't form any distinct object or pattern. The remaining numbers (3-9) are arranged in a series of horizontal lines, with some vertical connections between them. The transformation rule seems to involve identifying the objects formed by these horizontal and vertical lines and their persistence through the transformations. 

Output:

The output grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 10 columns. Each horizontal line from the input grid is copied to the corresponding row in the output grid, preserving the original numbers and maintaining the same arrangement of objects. The vertical connections between the horizontal lines are also maintained.

Case 2:
The input grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 11 columns. The background color (0) is present throughout but doesn't form any distinct object or pattern. The remaining numbers (3-9) are arranged in a series of horizontal and vertical lines, forming a lattice-like structure. The transformation rule seems to involve identifying the objects formed by these horizontal and vertical lines and their persistence through the transformations. 

Output:
The output grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 10 columns. Each horizontal line from the input grid is copied to the corresponding row in the output grid, preserving the original numbers and maintaining the same arrangement of objects. The vertical connections between the horizontal lines are also maintained, but some of the internal connections within the lattice structure have been removed.

Case 3:
The input grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 11 columns. The background color (0) is present throughout but doesn't form any distinct object or pattern. The remaining numbers (1-9) are arranged in a series of horizontal and vertical lines, forming a lattice-like structure. The transformation rule seems to involve identifying the objects formed by these horizontal and vertical lines and their persistence through the transformations. 

Output:
The output grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 10 columns. Each horizontal line from the input grid is copied to the corresponding row in the output grid, preserving the original numbers and maintaining the same arrangement of objects. The vertical connections between the horizontal lines are also maintained, but some of the internal connections within the lattice structure have been removed, similar to Case 2.

Case 4:
The input grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 11 columns. The background color (0) is present throughout but doesn't form any distinct object or pattern. The remaining numbers (1-9) are arranged in a series of horizontal and vertical lines, forming a lattice-like structure. The transformation rule seems to involve identifying the objects formed by these horizontal and vertical lines and their persistence through the transformations. 

Output:
The output grid has a rectangular shape with 12 rows and 10 columns. Each horizontal line from the input grid is copied to the corresponding row in the output grid, preserving the original numbers and maintaining the same arrangement of objects. The vertical connections between the horizontal lines are also maintained, but some of the internal connections within the lattice structure have been removed, similar to Cases 2 and 3.

In summary, for all cases, the transformation rule involves identifying the objects formed by the horizontal and/or vertical lines in the input grid and preserving their arrangement and persistence through the transformations. The output grids have a slightly smaller size (10x12) compared to the input grids (11x12), but this is consistent across all cases, as the top row and leftmost column of zeros are removed from the input grid in each case.
