To determine the transformation rule for each case, we need to analyze the given input and output pairs. Here's a summary of the transformations in each case:

Case 0:
- Transformation: Rotation of objects by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.
- The output grid has the same number of rows and columns as the input grid but rotated.

Case 1:
- Transformation: Rotation of objects by 180 degrees.
- The output grid has the same number of rows and columns as the input grid, but all the values are flipped horizontally (left to right).

Case 2:
- Transformation: Rotation of objects by 90 degrees counterclockwise or clockwise.
- The output grid has the same number of rows and columns as the input grid but rotated.

Case 3:
- Transformation: Rotation of objects by 180 degrees.
- The output grid has the same number of rows and columns as the input grid, but all the values are flipped horizontally (left to right).

Now let's apply these transformation rules to the last given input grid (Case 3):

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 9]
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3]
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the output grid has the same number of rows and columns as the input grid but rotated by 180 degrees.
