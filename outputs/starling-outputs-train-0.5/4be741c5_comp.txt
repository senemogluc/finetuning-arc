The transformation rule we induced from the previous input-output pairs involves recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, it seems like there are multiple instances of the same number (3) in a row, and they are grouped together with the 2's and 1's. 

To find the output grid, we can consider each instance of the same number as part of an object. We then count how many objects of each type exist in the input grid and place them in the output grid accordingly:

- There are 3 instances of 3, so there will be 3 3's in the output grid.

- There are 2 instances of 2, so there will be 2 2's in the output grid.

- There is only one instance of 1 and 8, respectively, so they will appear once each in the output grid.

Based on these observations, the output grid for the last input should be:

Output:
[3, 3, 3]
[2, 2]
[1, 8]
