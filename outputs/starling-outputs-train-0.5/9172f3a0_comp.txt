Case 3:
Input:
  [2, 5, 0]
  [8, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 7]

To generate the output grid for this case, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: There are three main objects in the input grid - a 2x2 object with value 5, an object with value 8, and another object with values 9 and 7. The 5-object is connected to the 0-background, while the other two objects are separate.
2. Apply counting or sorting tasks: There are no explicit counting or sorting tasks in this case.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: In this case, there is no direct physical contact between the objects. However, we can infer that the 5-object and the 0-background are connected due to their adjacency.
4. Pay attention to object transformations and persistence: The 5-object will persist in the output grid, while the other two objects (8 and 9) may undergo some transformation. Since there's no information about the interaction between the 5-object and the other objects, we can assume that they don't affect each other.
5. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects: There are no explicit numerical aspects in this case.
6. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: The 5-object is a square with side length 2, while the other two objects have no specific shape information.
7. Write down reasoning for each option and pick one: Since there's no information about how the 8-object and the 9-object interact, we can assume they don't affect the 5-object. Therefore, the 5-object will persist in the output grid with a side length of 2.
8. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule holds true for all previous cases.
9. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid: In this case, the output grid should have the same dimensions as the input grid.

Based on these steps, the output grid for the last input is:

  [2, 5, 2]
  [8, 0, 0]
  [9, 7, 0]
