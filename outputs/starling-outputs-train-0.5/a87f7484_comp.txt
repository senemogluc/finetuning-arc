Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, I will generate the output grid for the last input. Here's the reasoning behind each step:

1. Identify objects that are adjacent to each other with the same number. In this case, we have:
	* [0, 5, 0] is an object
	* [5, 0, 5] is an object
	* [0, 3, 0] is an object
	* [3, 0, 3] is an object
	* [6, 0, 6] is an object
	* [6, 6, 0] is an object
	* [0, 4, 0] is an object
	* [4, 0, 4] is an object
2. Apply the transformation rule that objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. In this case, we can see that all objects are unaffected by noise or occlusions.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Count the number of times each number appears in the input grid:
	* 0 appears 12 times
	* 5 appears 3 times
	* 6 appears 3 times
	* 7 appears 0 times (not relevant for this case)
	* 8 appears 3 times
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic to determine the output grid:

Output:
[0, 5, 0]
[5, 0, 5]
[0, 3, 0]
[3, 0, 3]
[0, 6, 0]
[6, 0, 6]
[0, 4, 0]
[4, 0, 4]

So the output grid for the last input is:

[0, 5, 0]
[5, 0, 5]
[0, 3, 0]
[3, 0, 3]
[0, 6, 0]
[6, 0, 6]
[0, 4, 0]
[4, 0, 4]
