To determine the transformation rule for each case and generate the output grid for the last given input grid, let's analyze each case separately.

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. The numbers are increasing by a constant value (3) in each row starting from the second row. To apply this rule to the input grid, we can subtract 3 from every number in the first row and add 3 to every number in the third and subsequent rows.

Case 1:
The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks with objects having a specific pattern or shape. In this case, it appears that the numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern with a constant increase by 2 (e.g., 5, 3, 5, 7, ...). To apply this rule to the input grid, we can find the starting point of the spiral and then increment each number by 2 while following the spiral pattern.

Case 2:
The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks with objects having a specific pattern or shape. In this case, it appears that the numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern with a constant increase by 1 (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, ...). To apply this rule to the input grid, we can find the starting point of the spiral and then increment each number by 1 while following the spiral pattern.

Case 3:
The transformation rule is not immediately apparent from the provided examples. However, since it's the last case, let's try applying the rules from the previous cases to see if they work. In this case, we can apply either Case 0 or Case 2 rules (subtracting or adding a constant value) but they don't seem to fit well with the input grid.

Based on the analysis of each case, here is the output grid for the last given input grid using the transformation rule from Case 1:

Output:
  [5, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8]
  [1, 1, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 3]
  [8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
