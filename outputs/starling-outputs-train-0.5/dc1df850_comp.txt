Here's a step-by-step explanation of the transformation process for the last input grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships:
   - There are four distinct objects in the grid: [7, 0], [2, 0], [0, 0], and [5, 0]. The first two appear twice, while the latter two appear three times each.
   - Objects [7, 0] and [2, 0] are connected horizontally, as they share a side.
   - Object [5, 0] is connected to the bottom-right corner of object [7, 0].

2. Apply the transformation rule:
   - Move objects [7, 0] and [2, 0] one step downward, resulting in their new positions at [6, 0] and [2, 1], respectively.
   - Keep object [5, 0] in its original position.
   - Fill the empty spaces left by objects [7, 0] and [2, 0] with zeros: [0, 0].

3. Generate the output grid:

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]

Output:

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
