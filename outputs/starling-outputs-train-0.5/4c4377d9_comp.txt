Based on the transformation rules provided and the previous cases, we can infer that the pattern in each case is to duplicate the input grid multiple times. In this case, it appears that the grid should be duplicated four times horizontally. 

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the objects in the grid: The grid consists of two types of objects: those with the value 4 and those with the value 9.
2. Analyze object relationships: The 4s are connected horizontally, while the 9s are also connected horizontally. There is no vertical connection between these two types of objects.
3. Apply counting or sorting tasks: In this case, there are two distinct groups of objects (4s and 9s) that can be counted separately. The number of 4s is equal to the number of 9s in each row, which is 2. 
4. Recognize geometric and topological aspects: Since the 4s and 9s are connected horizontally and have the same number of occurrences in each row, it's reasonable to assume that the grid should be duplicated horizontally to maintain the structure of the objects. 
5. Apply the transformation rule: Duplicate the input grid four times horizontally to create a larger grid with the same structure as the original one. 

Here's the output for the last input:

  [4, 4, 9, 9]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 9, 9]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 9, 9]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 9, 9]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 4, 9, 9]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
