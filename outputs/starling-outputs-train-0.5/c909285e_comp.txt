Here are some observations about the transformations that have occurred in the input grid:
1. Transformations between objects:
   a. Moving: A given object can move to another location on the grid, such as a piece moving from one cell to another cell.
   b. Rotating: A given object can rotate by 90 degrees (clockwise) in each step.
   c. Resizing: A given object can resize itself, changing its size while maintaining shape and position on the grid.
   d. Reshuffling: A given object can shuffle in a random manner, but still maintain its shape and position on the grid.
2. Transformations between objects:
   e. Merging: Two or more objects combine to form another single object (e.g. merging two circles into one).
   f. Splitting: One object can be divided into several smaller objects.
3. Transformation of the grid:
   g. Swapping: Two or more cells are swapped in the grid, changing their relative positions.
   h. Scaling: A given object can change its size while maintaining shape and position on the grid.
4. Transformations between numbers:
   i. Addition: Numbers are added to form another single number.
   j. Subtraction: Numbers are subtracted to form a single number.
5. Transformation of the grid:
   k. Rotation: A given cell is rotated by 90 degrees (clockwise) in each step.
6. Transformation of numbers:
   l. Addition: Numbers are added to form another single number.
7. Transformation of numbers:
   m. Subtraction: Numbers are subtracted to form a single number.
