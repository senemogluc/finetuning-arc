Given the previous cases and transformation rules, we can infer that the transformation rule focuses on connecting same numbers adjacent to each other, maintaining persistence despite noise or occlusion, recognizing physical contact between objects, and tasks involving counting or sorting. 

In this case, we have the following input grid:

Input:
  [8, 8, 4, 5]
  [3, 8, 7, 5]
  [3, 7, 1, 9]
  [6, 4, 8, 8]

To apply the transformation rule, we will:

1. Identify objects based on same numbers adjacent to each other.
2. Preserve persistence despite noise or occlusion.
3. Recognize physical contact between objects (if any).
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for numerical aspects.
5. Use elementary geometry and topology concepts.

After analyzing the input grid, we can identify the following objects:

- Object 1: [8, 8, 4, 5]
- Object 2: [3, 8, 7, 5]
- Object 3: [3, 7, 1, 9]
- Object 4: [6, 4, 8, 8]

Now, we will apply the transformation rule to connect adjacent same numbers and maintain persistence:

Output:
  [8, 8, 8, 5]
  [3, 8, 7, 5]
  [3, 7, 1, 9]
  [6, 4, 8, 8]

So the output grid for the last input is:

  [8, 8, 8, 5]
  [3, 8, 7, 5]
  [3, 7, 1, 9]
  [6, 4, 8, 8]
