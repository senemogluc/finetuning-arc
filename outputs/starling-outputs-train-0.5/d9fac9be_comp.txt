Here are my step-by-step thoughts and reasoning for each option:

Case 0:
- The input grid has a central pattern of 2x3 squares with the number 8. This pattern repeats itself vertically and horizontally, with some noise around it (numbers 4). However, there is no clear transformation rule that can be applied to the entire grid.
- Output: [8] - The only number left in the grid after removing the noise.

Case 1:
- The input grid has a central pattern of 3x3 squares with the number 8 surrounded by noise (numbers 0, 2, and 4).
- There are two distinct patterns in the grid: one with the number 8 in the center and another with the number 3. The first pattern repeats itself horizontally and vertically, while the second pattern is isolated.
- Output: [8] - The only number left in the grid after removing the noise.

Case 2:
- The input grid has a central pattern of 4x3 squares with the number 1 surrounded by noise (numbers 0, 2, and 4). This pattern repeats itself horizontally and vertically.
- Output: [1] - The only number left in the grid after removing the noise.

Case 3:
- The input grid has a central pattern of 5x3 squares with the number 8 surrounded by noise (numbers 0, 2, 3, and 4). This pattern repeats itself horizontally and vertically.
- Output: [8] - The only number left in the grid after removing the noise.

Case 4:
- The input grid has a central pattern of 5x6 squares with the number 1 surrounded by noise (numbers 0, 2, 3, and 4). This pattern repeats itself horizontally and vertically. However, there is no clear transformation rule that can be applied to the entire grid.
- Output: [1] - The only number left in the grid after removing the noise.

Based on the analysis above, the output of the last input (Case 4) should be:

Output: [1]
