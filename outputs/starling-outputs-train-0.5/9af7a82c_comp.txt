Given the input grid and the transformation rules, it's difficult to determine a specific output grid without more context or information about the goal or intention guiding the transformations. The transformation rules provided are quite general and can lead to multiple possible outputs depending on the interpretation of the priors. 

Here are some possible interpretations for the last input:

1. If we consider the task as sorting objects by their values, we could have:
   Output:
     [8, 8, 2, 0]
     [1, 8, 8, 0]
     [1, 3, 3, 0]
     [1, 1, 1, 0]

2. If we consider the task as counting occurrences of each value, we could have:
   Output:
     [4, 8, 4, 2]
     [4, 8, 4, 0]
     [4, 8, 4, 0]
     [4, 8, 4, 0]

3. If we consider the task as identifying and separating objects with different values, we could have:
   Output:
     [8, 8, 2, 0]
     [1, 8, 8, 0]
     [1, 3, 3, 0]
     [1, 1, 1, 0]

These are just a few examples of how the transformation rules can be applied to the input grid. Without more specific information about the goal or intention guiding the transformations, it's not possible to provide a single output grid that corresponds to the last given input grid using the induced transformation rule.
