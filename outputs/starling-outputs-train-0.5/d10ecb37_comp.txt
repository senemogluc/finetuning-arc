To infer the transformation rule, we can look for patterns and relationships between objects in the given inputs. The main pattern here is that adjacent numbers with the same value are part of the same object. Additionally, objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.

Now, let's analyze the last input:

Input:
  [9, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 9]
  [2, 9, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9, 2]
  [6, 9, 9, 2, 2, 9, 9, 6]
  [9, 2, 6, 9, 9, 6, 2, 9]

We can see that there are four main objects in the input grid:
1. The top-left object with values 9, 6, and 2.
2. The top-right object with values 9, 9, 9, and 2.
3. The bottom-left object with values 9, 9, 2, and 6.
4. The bottom-right object with values 9, 6, 2, and 9.

Now, let's apply the transformation rule:

1. Object 1 is transformed into a single object with values [9, 6, 2].
2. Object 2 is transformed into a single object with values [9, 9, 9, 2].
3. Object 3 is transformed into a single object with values [9, 9, 2, 6].
4. Object 4 is transformed into a single object with values [9, 6, 2, 9].

The output grid should be:

Output:
  [9, 6, 2]
  [9, 9, 9, 2]
  [9, 9, 2, 6]
  [9, 6, 2, 9]
