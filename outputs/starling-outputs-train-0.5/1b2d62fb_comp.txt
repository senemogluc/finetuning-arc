In order to find the transformation rule, let's analyze the previous cases and identify common patterns or goals. 

Case 0: The grid seems to consist of several 3x3 blocks with the same pattern, but one block has a different pattern (8,8) in the middle. This case could be related to counting or sorting objects. 

Case 1: The grid is similar to Case 0, but with an additional row and column. Here, we can see that all the 3x3 blocks have the same pattern, except for one block in the center (8,8). Again, this case involves counting or sorting objects.

Case 2: This grid also consists of several 3x3 blocks with the same pattern, but there are some differences in the arrangement of the blocks compared to previous cases. The goal here is to transform the blocks and align them in a specific way.

Case 3: Similar to Case 0, this grid has several 3x3 blocks with the same pattern, but one block has a different pattern (8,8) in the middle. Counting or sorting objects seems to be the goal here.

Case 4: This case is also similar to Case 0, with some differences in the arrangement of the blocks. The goal here might be to transform and align the blocks in a specific way.

Based on these cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves counting or sorting objects, and possibly arranging them in a specific pattern. In the last input grid, we can identify several 3x3 blocks with the same pattern, but one block has a different pattern (8,8) in the middle:

Input:
  [9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0]
  [0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0]
  [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 0, 9]
  [0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 9, 9]

Output:
  [0, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 8]
  [8, 0, 8]
  [8, 8, 0]

In this case, the transformation rule involves counting or sorting objects and arranging them in a specific pattern. The output grid has the same size as the input grid, with the transformed blocks arranged according to the rule we induced from previous cases.
