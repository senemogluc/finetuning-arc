Given the transformation rules and the previous cases, we can infer that the goal of this task is to identify groups of objects with the same number and arrange them in a specific pattern. In this case, the pattern seems to be alternating between the number 3 and its multiples (8). Here's how we can generate the output grid:

1. Identify all instances of the number 3 in the input grid.
2. For each instance of 3, find all adjacent 8s, and replace them with 3s. If there are no adjacent 8s, leave the 8s unchanged.
3. Repeat step 2 until no more changes can be made.

Following these steps:

1. Identify instances of 3: [(0, 4), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7)]
2. Replace adjacent 8s with 3s:
   - (0, 4) is not adjacent to any 8s, so no change.
   - (5, 7) is adjacent to an 8 at (4, 6). Change the 8 to a 3: [(0, 4), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7)] becomes [(0, 4), (3, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7)].
   - (6, 7) is adjacent to an 8 at (5, 6). Change the 8 to a 3: [(0, 4), (3, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7)] becomes [(0, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (7, 7)].
   - (7, 7) is not adjacent to any 8s, so no change.
3. No more changes can be made.
