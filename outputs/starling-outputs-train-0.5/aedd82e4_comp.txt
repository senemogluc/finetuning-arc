Here's a breakdown of each case and the transformation rules applied:

Case 0:
- Transformation Rule: Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Reasoning: The objects with number 2 in the input grid are adjacent to each other, so they form a single object. The object with number 1 is also formed by the adjacent 0s.

Case 1:
- Transformation Rule: Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Reasoning: The objects with number 2 in the input grid are adjacent to each other, so they form a single object. The object with number 1 is also formed by the adjacent 0s.

Case 2:
- Transformation Rule: Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Reasoning: The objects with number 2 in the input grid are adjacent to each other, so they form a single object. The object with number 1 is also formed by the adjacent 0s.

Case 3:
- Transformation Rule: Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Reasoning: The objects with number 2 in the input grid are adjacent to each other, so they form a single object. The object with number 1 is also formed by the adjacent 0s.

Case 4:
- Transformation Rule: Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
- Reasoning: The objects with number 2 in the input grid are adjacent to each other, so they form a single object. The object with number 1 is also formed by the adjacent 0s.

For the last input case (Case 4), the output grid would be:

  [2, 2, 0, 2]
  [0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 2, 2]

In this case, the transformation rule is applied to form objects based on adjacent numbers. The output grid has the same number of objects as the input grid, and each object's shape and position are preserved in the transformation.
