Based on the previous cases and the transformation rules provided, we can infer that the goal here is to identify and group objects with the same number value. The transformation rule involves counting and basic arithmetic, recognizing object relationships, transformations, and persistence. 

For the last input grid, we can see that there are four main groups of objects:
1. The top-left group with values [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5] (transformed to [2, 2, 2])
2. The middle-top group with values [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0] (transformed to [4, 4, 4])
3. The middle-bottom group with values [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0] (transformed to [2, 2, 2])
4. The bottom-right group with values [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5] (transformed to [3, 3, 3])

By applying the transformation rule, we get the following output grid:

Output:
[2, 2, 2]
[4, 4, 4]
[2, 2, 2]
[3, 3, 3]
