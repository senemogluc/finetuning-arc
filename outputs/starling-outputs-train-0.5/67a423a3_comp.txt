Based on the provided input and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies to all cases. However, we can try to infer a transformation rule for this particular case (Case 3) by analyzing the patterns in the input grid.

In Case 3, there are several rows of identical values (5's), and the first and last columns have a pattern of increasing values (3's). We can observe that the middle column is filled with 0's, except for the top and bottom rows where it has 3's.

Here's a possible transformation rule for this case:

1. Identify the rows of identical values (5's) and consider them as objects.
2. Recognize that the middle column is filled with 0's, except for the top and bottom rows where it has 3's. This can be seen as a pattern related to counting or sorting objects.
3. Replace the 5's in each row with the corresponding value from the pattern in the middle column (3's).
4. Fill the remaining cells in the grid with 0's.

Applying this transformation rule to the input grid, we get the following output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

However, this transformation rule might not apply to other cases or different input grids. It's essential to consider the context and relationships between objects in each case to determine the appropriate transformation rules.
