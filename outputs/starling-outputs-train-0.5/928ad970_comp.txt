Here's a breakdown of the transformation process for the last given input:

1. Identify and separate objects based on their neighboring numbers that are adjacent to each other. In this case, we have 8 as the main object with a size of 3x3 (since there are 8s in three rows).
2. Transform the grid by moving the identified objects without changing their shape or size. Here, we can move the 8 object along the horizontal axis to the right while maintaining its position in the vertical axis. 
3. Replace the original grid with the transformed grid.

Following these steps, the output grid would be:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This is the output grid for the last given input.
