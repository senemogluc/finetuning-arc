To generate the output grid for the last input grid, we can apply the following transformation rule:

1. Identify and group objects that are adjacent to each other and have the same number (in this case, 0, 3, 4, and 7).
2. Ensure that the persistence of objects despite noise or occlusion is maintained.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects, and compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
4. Apply basic arithmetic for numerical aspects (e.g., adding or subtracting values).
5. Use elementary geometry and topology concepts to determine the transformation, such as translations, rotations, or reflections.

Here's the output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 11, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 11, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
