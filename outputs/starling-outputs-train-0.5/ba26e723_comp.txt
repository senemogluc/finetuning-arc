Here are the reasoning steps for each case:

Case 0:
- The grid consists of a single object with color 4 surrounded by background (color 0).
- The transformation rule states that objects persist despite noise or occlusion. However, in this case, there is no noise or occlusion.
- The rule also mentions recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we don't have a clear counting or sorting task.
- There are no physical interactions between objects in the grid. Therefore, the transformation should maintain the original structure of the grid.

Case 1:
- The grid consists of two objects with color 4 surrounded by background (color 0).
- The transformation rule states that objects persist despite noise or occlusion. However, in this case, there is no noise or occlusion.
- The rule also mentions recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we don't have a clear counting or sorting task.
- There are no physical interactions between objects in the grid. Therefore, the transformation should maintain the original structure of the grid.

Case 2:
- The grid consists of a single object with color 4 surrounded by background (color 0).
- The transformation rule states that objects persist despite noise or occlusion. However, in this case, there is no noise or occlusion.
- The rule also mentions recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we don't have a clear counting or sorting task.
- There are no physical interactions between objects in the grid. Therefore, the transformation should maintain the original structure of the grid.

Case 3:
- The grid consists of a single object with color 4 surrounded by background (color 0).
- The transformation rule states that objects persist despite noise or occlusion. However, in this case, there is no noise or occlusion.
- The rule also mentions recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we don't have a clear counting or sorting task.
- There are no physical interactions between objects in the grid. Therefore, the transformation should maintain the original structure of the grid.

Case 4:
- The grid consists of a single object with color 4 surrounded by background (color 0).
- The transformation rule states that objects persist despite noise or occlusion. However, in this case, there is no noise or occlusion.
- The rule also mentions recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we don't have a clear counting or sorting task.
- There are no physical interactions between objects in the grid. Therefore, the transformation should maintain the original structure of the grid.

Case 5:
- The grid consists of a single object with color 4 surrounded by background (color 0).
- The transformation rule states that objects persist despite noise or occlusion. However, in this case, there is no noise or occlusion.
- The rule also mentions recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we don't have a clear counting or sorting task.
- There are no physical interactions between objects in the grid. Therefore, the transformation should maintain the original structure of the grid.

Since none of the cases involve any specific transformations based on the rules provided, the output should be the same as the input:

Input:
  [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]

Output:
  [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]
