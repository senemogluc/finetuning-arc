Based on the previous cases and transformation rules, I would infer that the output for the last input grid should be as follows:

Case 3 Output:
  [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
