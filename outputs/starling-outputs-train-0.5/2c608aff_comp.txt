It's difficult to determine a specific output for this case since there are no clear rules or patterns provided in the transformation rule. The input itself doesn't seem to follow any specific pattern that can be used as a basis for creating an output grid. 

However, if you provide more context or clarify the transformation rule, I would be glad to help you analyze the case and generate an appropriate output grid.
