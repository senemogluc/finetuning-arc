Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify adjacent numbers that are the same and group them together as objects. In this case, we can see that the adjacent numbers 0, 1, and 2 form three distinct groups of objects.
2. Transform the grid by moving objects with the same number to the right. For example, all objects with number 1 will move one position to the right.
3. Merge any overlapping objects during the transformation process. In this case, there are no overlaps, so the transformation remains unchanged.
4. The final output grid is formed by applying the transformation rule.

Applying these steps to the last input:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]

Output:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
[1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

The output grid is the same as the transformed input grid, which means no transformation occurred. The reason for this is that all the objects in the grid are distinct and non-overlapping, so there's no need to merge or move them during the transformation process.
