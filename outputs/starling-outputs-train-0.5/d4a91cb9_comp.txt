Here are the steps to find the transformation rule and apply it to the last input grid:

1. Identify adjacent objects with the same color (number) in the input grids.
2. For each object, determine its size by counting the number of cells it occupies.
3. Calculate the average size of all objects in the grid.
4. Scale each object's size proportionally to the average size while maintaining their relative positions.
5. Apply the scaling transformation to the last input grid.

Applying these steps to the last input grid:

1. Adjacent objects are found as follows:

   - Top-left object (8): 3x3 cells
   - Bottom-center object (2): 2x2 cells

2. Object sizes:

   - Top-left object (8): 9 cells
   - Bottom-center object (2): 4 cells

3. Average size: (9 + 4) / 2 = 6.5 cells

4. Scale each object proportionally to the average size:

   - Top-left object (8): 9 * (6.5 / 9) = 6.5 cells
   - Bottom-center object (2): 4 * (6.5 / 4) = 6.5 cells

5. Apply the scaling transformation to the last input grid:
