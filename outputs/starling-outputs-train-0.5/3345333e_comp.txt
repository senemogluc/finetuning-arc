Based on the given transformation rules and previous inputs, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input. The transformation rule focuses on objects that are adjacent to each other with the same values, but the last input doesn't have any such objects.

Here are some possible interpretations of the transformation rule for this case:

1. Treat each 5 as an object and merge all the 5s horizontally or vertically into a single large object. In this case, the output grid would be:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

1. Treat each object as a single entity and merge all the objects horizontally or vertically into a single large object. In this case, the output grid would be:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that these are just two possible interpretations of the transformation rule for the last input. Other interpretations might lead to different output grids.
