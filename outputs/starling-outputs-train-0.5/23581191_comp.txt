Based on the provided information and the transformation rules, it's not possible to determine a unique output for the last input. The transformation rules focus on recognizing patterns, counting, and sorting objects, but they don't provide specific guidance on how to handle cases with only one object in the grid (as in this case). 

To generate an output grid, we would need more context or additional rules to guide the transformation process.
