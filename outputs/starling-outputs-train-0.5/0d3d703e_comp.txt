For the last input case, we have:

Input:
  [8, 1, 3]
  [8, 1, 3]
  [8, 1, 3]

We can observe that the numbers are in a straight horizontal line. To create a transformation based on this observation, we can shift each number one position to the right and then fill the first column with the next number in the sequence:

Output:
  [2, 4, 6]
  [2, 4, 6]
  [2, 4, 6]

This transformation is consistent with the previous input-output pairs as it maintains object relationships and persistence while involving a counting or sorting aspect.
