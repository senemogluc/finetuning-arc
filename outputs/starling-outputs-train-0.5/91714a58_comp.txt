Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify adjacent same numbers:
   - In the first row, there are two groups: {0} and {3}, and {5}.
   - In the second row, there is one group: {0}.
   - In the third row, there are three groups: {6}, {8}, and {1}.
   - In the fourth row, there are two groups: {2} and {4}.
   - In the fifth row, there are no adjacent same numbers.
   - In the sixth row, there is one group: {5}.
   - In the seventh row, there are two groups: {0} and {3}, and {7}.
   - In the eighth row, there are three groups: {2}, {4}, and {6}.
   - In the ninth row, there is one group: {1}.
   - In the tenth row, there are no adjacent same numbers.
   - In the eleventh row, there are two groups: {0} and {8}.
   - In the twelfth row, there are three groups: {2}, {3}, and {5}.
   - In the thirteenth row, there are no adjacent same numbers.
   - In the fourteenth row, there are two groups: {2} and {4}.
   - In the fifteenth row, there is one group: {0}.
   - In the sixteenth row, there are three groups: {3}, {7}, and {9}.
   - In the seventeenth row, there are no adjacent same numbers.

2. Transform adjacent same numbers into a single cell with the maximum value:
   - The first row becomes [0, 0, 7, 1, 4, 0, 0, 9, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The second row remains unchanged.
   - The third row becomes [6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The fourth row remains unchanged.
   - The fifth row remains unchanged.
   - The sixth row becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The seventh row becomes [0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The eighth row remains unchanged.
   - The ninth row becomes [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The tenth row remains unchanged.
   - The eleventh row becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The twelfth row becomes [0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The thirteenth row remains unchanged.
   - The fourteenth row becomes [2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The fifteenth row remains unchanged.
   - The sixteenth row becomes [3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - The seventeenth row remains unchanged.

Here's the final output grid:

  [0, 0, 7, 1, 4, 0, 0, 9, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
