Case 3:
Input:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

To generate the output grid, we will follow the transformation rule and consider object relationships, transformations, and persistence. We will also apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.

First, let's identify the objects in the input grid:
- Object 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
- Object 2: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Now, we will apply the transformation rule to find the output grid:

1. Since objects with the same numbers are adjacent to each other, we can merge them while maintaining their order. For example, Object 1 and Object 2 can be merged horizontally as follows:
   - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] [7, 7, 7, 7, 7] -> [1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7]

2. We can also merge objects vertically while maintaining their order:
   - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] [7, 7, 7, 7, 7] -> [7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1]

3. In some cases, objects might be rotated or flipped to maintain their order:
   - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] [7, 7, 7, 7, 7] -> [7, 7, 7, 1, 1, 1] (rotated)
   - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] [7, 7, 7, 7, 7] -> [1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7] (flipped)

Based on the transformation rule and the given input grid, we can generate several possible output grids. Here are some examples:

Output Grid 1:
  [1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7]
  [7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1]

Output Grid 2:
  [7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1]
  [1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7]

Output Grid 3 (rotated):
  [7, 7, 1, 1, 1, 7]
  [7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1]

Output Grid 4 (flipped):
  [7, 7, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1]

Please note that the actual output grid could be any of these grids or a different one entirely, depending on the specific transformation rule applied.
