To determine the transformation rule for the given cases, we can analyze the patterns and relationships between the objects in each case. Here are the observations from the previous cases:

1. The numbers on adjacent cells are part of the same object.
2. Objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.
3. Physical contact between objects is recognized (translation, rebounding).
4. Tasks involving counting or sorting objects are considered.
5. Basic arithmetic and geometry concepts are applied.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:

1. If two adjacent cells have the same number, merge them into a single object with that number increased by 3 (e.g., 2 becomes 5, 8 becomes 5).
2. If there's no adjacent cell with the same number, the cell remains unchanged.
3. If a cell has a lower number than its neighbors, it will be replaced by the maximum number of its neighbors minus 1 (e.g., if a cell is surrounded by 4, 5, and 6, it becomes 5).

Now let's apply this transformation rule to the last input:

Input:
  [3, 3, 8]
  [4, 4, 4]
  [8, 1, 1]

First, merge adjacent cells with the same number:
  [5, 5, 11]
  [5, 5, 5]
  [11, 3, 3]

Next, replace lower-numbered cells with the maximum number of their neighbors minus 1:
  [8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8]
  [8, 5, 5]

Output:
  [8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8]
  [5, 5, 5]
