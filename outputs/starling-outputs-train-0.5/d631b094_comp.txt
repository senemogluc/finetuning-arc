Based on the previous cases and transformation rules, we can infer that the transformation rule is to find objects with the same number adjacent to each other and merge them into a single object. Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify objects with the same number adjacent to each other. In this case, there are three objects: one with the number 4 at the top-left corner, another with the number 4 at the middle-left corner, and a third one with the number 4 at the bottom-right corner.
2. Merge these objects into a single object by summing their values: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.
3. The output grid should now contain only one object with the merged value (12) and have the same dimensions as the input grid.

Based on this reasoning, the output grid for the last input is:

  [12]
