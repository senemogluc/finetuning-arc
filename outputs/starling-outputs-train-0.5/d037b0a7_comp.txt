To generate the output grid for the last given input grid using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs, we will consider the mentioned priors and apply them to the problem. Here's the reasoning process for each step:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have three distinct objects with different numbers (4, 0, 8, and 7). The relationship between these objects is that they are adjacent to each other.
2. Consider object transformations and persistence: Since there is no information about the physical contact or interactions between these objects, we can assume that their positions will remain unchanged during the transformation process.
3. Identify goals or intentions: There's no specific goal mentioned in this case, so we can focus on maintaining the relative positions of the objects.
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: No numerical aspects are present in this problem.
5. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: Since there are no changes in the object's positions or shapes, we don't need to apply any geometry or topology concepts.
6. Check if the transformation works for previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule seems to be working fine for all the given cases.
7. Output grid should be the same size as the input grid: In this case, the input grid is a 3x3 grid, so the output grid will also be a 3x3 grid.

Based on these steps and reasoning, the output grid corresponding to the last given input grid is:

[4, 0, 8]
[0, 7, 0]
[0, 0, 0]
