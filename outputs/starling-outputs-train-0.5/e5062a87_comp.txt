Here's an analysis of the given cases and their transformations:

Case 0:
The transformation rule appears to be maintaining the same structure of objects as in the input grid while possibly rotating or reflecting them. The main goal seems to be preserving the adjacency of the same numbers, which are part of the same object.

Output:
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 2]
  [5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 5, 5]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 2, 0]
  [2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5]
  [5, 2, 0, 5, 0, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 5, 5, 0]

Case 1:
The transformation rule in this case seems to be rotating the grid by 90 degrees clockwise. The main goal appears to be preserving the adjacency of the same numbers while changing their positions relative to each other.

Output:
  [5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5]
  [5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5]
  [5, 2, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]
  [5, 2, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
The transformation rule in this case seems to be rotating the grid by 180 degrees. The main goal appears to be preserving the adjacency of the same numbers while changing their positions relative to each other.

Output:
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5]
  [5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5]
  [5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]
  [5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5]
  [5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 5, 0, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5]

Case 3:
The transformation rule in this case seems to be rotating the grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise. The main goal appears to be preserving the adjacency of the same numbers while changing their positions relative to each other.

Output:
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 0, 5]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]
  [5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Based on the analysis of these cases and their transformations, the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
