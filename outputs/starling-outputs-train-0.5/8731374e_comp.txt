Here's an explanation of how I arrived at the output for the last input grid:

1. Identify adjacent objects that are the same and have the same number (e.g., 1, 2, and 3). In this case, we can see that there are several groups of adjacent numbers with the same value:
   - [9, 9] in the top-right corner
   - [8, 8] near the center of the grid
   - [4, 4] near the bottom-left corner
   - [2, 2], [3, 3], and [5, 5] in different locations
   - [6, 6], [7, 7], and [8, 8] near the center of the grid

2. For each group of adjacent numbers with the same value, replace them with a single number equal to the minimum value in that group (e.g., replace all occurrences of 9 with 1, 8 with 2, and so on). In this case:
   - Replace [9, 9] with 1
   - Replace [8, 8] with 2
   - Replace [4, 4] with 3
   - Replace [2, 2], [3, 3], and [5, 5] with 4
   - Replace [6, 6], [7, 7], and [8, 8] with 5

The resulting grid is:

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
