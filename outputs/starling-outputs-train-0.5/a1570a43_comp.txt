In order to determine the transformation rule and generate the output grid for the last input grid, we need to analyze the given cases and identify common patterns or rules. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Analyze each case to understand the transformations applied to the input grids.
2. Identify the rules governing the transformations in each case.
3. Apply these rules to the last input grid and generate an output grid.
4. Check if the generated output grid is consistent with the transformation rule and previous input-output pairs.

After analyzing the cases, we can observe that the main transformation rule is:

- Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.

Applying this rule to the last input grid, we get the following output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rule and previous input-output pairs.
