Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation process for the last input grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships:
   - The first object is a square with 4 connected 1's (top left).
   - The second object is also a square with 4 connected 1's (bottom right).
   - The third object is a vertical strip of 3 connected 1's (left side).
   - The fourth object is a horizontal strip of 2 connected 1's (top right).
   - The fifth object is a single connected 4 (top center).
   - The sixth object is a single connected 2 (bottom center).

2. Apply the transformation rule:
   - The first and second objects are identical squares, so they remain unchanged.
   - The third object can be shifted horizontally to align with the fourth object, creating a larger square.
   - The fifth and sixth objects can be combined into a single connected 6 (top center).

3. Generate the output grid:
   [3, 3, 3, 3]
   [3, 0, 3, 3]
   [3, 3, 3, 3]
   [3, 3, 3, 3]

So, the output of the last input is:

  [3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 0, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3]
