Here's an analysis of the transformation rule for each case:

Case 0:
- The same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object. This is already observed in the input grid, as there are no objects with different colors adjacent to each other. So, we don't need to change anything here.
- Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. In this case, all objects have a single color, so there is no occlusion or noise.
- Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. There are no objects with different colors that interact in this grid. So, we don't need to change anything here.
- Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects. In this case, there is only one number (5) present, so we don't need to change anything here.

Based on the analysis, the output should be the same as the input grid for Case 0:

[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:
- The same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object. In this case, we have objects with color 4 and 5. We can separate them into two different objects.
- Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. There is no noise or occlusion in this grid.
- Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. The objects with colors 4 and 5 don't interact, so we don't need to change anything here.
- Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects. In this case, there are two different numbers (4 and 5) present, so we need to separate them into two different objects.

Based on the analysis, the output for Case 1 should be:

[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
- The same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object. In this case, we have objects with color 4 and 6. We can separate them into two different objects.
- Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. There is no noise or occlusion in this grid.
- Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. The objects with colors 4 and 6 don't interact, so we don't need to change anything here.
- Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects. In this case, there are two different numbers (4 and 6) present, so we need to separate them into two different objects.

Based on the analysis, the output for Case 2 should be:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Case 3:
- The same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object. In this case, we have objects with color 3 and 5. We can separate them into two different objects.
- Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. There is no noise or occlusion in this grid.
- Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. The objects with colors 3 and 5 don't interact, so we don't need to change anything here.
- Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects. In this case, there are two different numbers (3 and 5) present, so we need to separate them into two different objects.

Based on the analysis, the output for Case 3 should be:

[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

- Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. There is no noise or occlusion in this grid.
- Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. The objects with colors 8 and 5 don't interact, so we don't need to change anything here.
- Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects. In this case, there are two different numbers (8 and 5) present, so we need to separate them into two different objects.
