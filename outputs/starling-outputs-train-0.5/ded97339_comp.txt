Case 3:

To determine the transformation rule for this case, we can analyze the previous cases and look for patterns. In the previous cases, we observed that objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object, and objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. The presence of counting or sorting tasks also seems important in determining the transformation rule.

In this case, there are no clear patterns of adjacent numbers or counting/sorting tasks. However, we can observe that the input grid has two distinct regions with the number 8: one at the top-left corner and another at the bottom-right corner. The background (0) values seem to separate these two regions.

Based on this observation, we can infer a transformation rule where the two regions with the number 8 are connected by moving the top-left 8 downwards while maintaining its position relative to the surrounding 0s:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This transformation rule connects the two regions with the number 8 and maintains their relative positions to the surrounding background values.
