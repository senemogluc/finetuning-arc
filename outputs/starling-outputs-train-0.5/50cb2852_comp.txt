Here's the reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule is to merge adjacent objects with the same color value. The grid seems to have a structure where each number (1-3) forms an object, and they are arranged in rows and columns. In this case, we can see that the 2's form a square shape around the 3's. To obtain the output grid, we merge all adjacent 2's with the same color value:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]
  [0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Case 1:

The transformation rule is the same as in Case 0. The grid seems to have a structure where each number (2) forms an object, and they are arranged in rows and columns. To obtain the output grid, we merge all adjacent 2's with the same color value:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:

The transformation rule is the same as in Case 0. The grid seems to have a structure where each number (2) forms an object, and they are arranged in rows and columns. To obtain the output grid, we merge all adjacent 2's with the same color value:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 3:

The transformation rule is the same as in Case 0. The grid seems to have a structure where each number (2) forms an object, and they are arranged in rows and columns. To obtain the output grid, we merge all adjacent 2's with the same color value:

Output:
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
