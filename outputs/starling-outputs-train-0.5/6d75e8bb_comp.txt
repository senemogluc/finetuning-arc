Based on the given priors and previous input-output pairs, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. However, we can try to analyze the pattern in the input grid and make some assumptions about the transformation rule. 

In this case, the last input grid has a repeating pattern of 8's with alternating zeros. The pattern seems to be arranged in a 3x3 grid. We can assume that the transformation rule might involve rotating or reflecting these patterns while preserving their structure. 

Here's one possible output grid based on this assumption:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that this is just one possible output grid based on the assumptions made. There might be other valid outputs depending on the actual transformation rule.
