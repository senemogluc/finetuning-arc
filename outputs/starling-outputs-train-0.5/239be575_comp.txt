To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the previous cases and their corresponding outputs.

Case 0: The grid is simplified to a single 8.
Case 1: The grid is simplified to a single 8.
Case 2: The grid is simplified to a single 8.
Case 3: The grid is simplified to a single 0.
Case 4: The grid is simplified to a single 8.
Case 5: The grid is simplified to a single 0.

From the cases above, we can observe that the transformation rule is to reduce the grid to a single 8 or 0, depending on whether there are any 8s in the input grid. If there's at least one 8, the output will be 8; otherwise, it will be 0.

Now let's apply this rule to the last input:

Input:
  [2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 8]
  [2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]

There are multiple 8s in the input grid. Therefore, the output will be:

Output:
  [8]
