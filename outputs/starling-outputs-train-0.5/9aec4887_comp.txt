Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to derive the transformation rule and apply it to the last input grid:

1. Identify objects and their properties: In the given grid, we can see that there are 3 types of objects:
   - Object A (value 7): Appears in the first row with a pattern of AAAABBBBA.
   - Object B (value 4): Appears in the second row with a pattern of BBAAABBBBA.
   - Object C (value 2): Appears in the third and fourth rows with a pattern of CCAAACCCCA.
   - Object D (value 1): Appears in the fifth to eighth rows with a pattern of DDDDA.
   - Object E (value 0): Background color.

2. Analyze object interactions: We can observe that objects A, B, and C interact with each other in the second row (object B) and third/fourth rows (objects C). The interaction is a translation of one object relative to the other. For example, object A moves down one position while object B moves up one position.

3. Determine the transformation rule: Based on the analysis above, we can derive the following transformation rule for each row:
   - Row 1: Copy object A as is.
   - Rows 2 and 4: Translate object B down by one position and translate object C up by one position.
   - Rows 3 and 5 to 8: Copy object D as is.
   - Rows 9 to 11: Translate object E left by one position (assuming the grid extends horizontally).
   - Row 12: Copy object A as is (since it's the same as row 1).

4. Apply the transformation rule to the last input grid:

   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:

  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [4, 8, 7, 0, 8, 6, 4, 4]
  [4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 6, 4, 4]
  [4, 0, 8, 0, 6, 6, 4, 4]
  [4, 8, 1, 0, 8, 6, 4, 4]
