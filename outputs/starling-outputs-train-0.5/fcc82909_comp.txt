Based on the given priors and transformations, the output for the last input grid (Case 3) should be as follows:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 0, 0]
  [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning for each step:

1. The first row is unchanged since there are no adjacent numbers that should be merged.
2. In the second row, the numbers 1 and 2 are adjacent, so they are combined to form a single object with the value 3.
3. The third row has two adjacent objects (numbers 1 and 2) that can be merged into one object with the value 4.
4. In the fourth row, the numbers 7 and 8 are adjacent, so they are combined to form a single object with the value 9.
5. The remaining rows have no adjacent objects that need to be merged.
