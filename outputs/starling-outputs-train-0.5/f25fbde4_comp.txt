Based on the transformation rules induced from previous cases, we can infer that the output grid should have the same objects as in the input grid but with their positions and sizes transformed. In this case, there are two distinct objects: one with a value of 0 and another with a value of 4. The 0s form a 3x3 grid in the center of the input grid, while the 4s form a 3x3 grid around it.

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the objects and their positions in the input grid. There are two distinct objects with values 0 and 4. The 0s form a 3x3 grid in the center, while the 4s form a 3x3 grid around it.
2. Transform the objects by moving them to the corners of the output grid while maintaining their original size. This can be done by shifting the whole grid horizontally and vertically, so that the top-left corner of the 0 grid is at (0, 0), the bottom-right corner of the 4 grid is at (7, 7), and the other corners are at (3, 0) and (0, 3).
3. The resulting output grid will have a 3x3 grid of 0s in the top-left corner, a 3x3 grid of 4s in the bottom-right corner, and two additional 4s at (3, 0) and (0, 3).

Based on this reasoning, the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
