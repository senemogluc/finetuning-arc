In the given cases, we have a series of input-output pairs that represent 2D grids. The transformation rules seem to involve recognizing and leveraging the properties of objects in the grid, such as their adjacency, persistence through noise or occlusion, physical contact, counting or sorting, and basic arithmetic.

For Case 4, the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the previous cases and transformation rules, we can infer that the output grid should have objects with the same number adjacent to each other merged into a single object, with the number of the merged object being the sum of the original numbers.

Here's a possible output for Case 4:

  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid maintains the adjacency of objects with the same number and transforms them by merging their values.
