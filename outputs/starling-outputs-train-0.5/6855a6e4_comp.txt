Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent numbers that are part of the same object. In this case, we can identify the following objects:
   - Object 1: [0, 5, 5, 5]
   - Object 2: [0, 5, 5, 0]

2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. We have two objects with different counts of 5s. The first object has three 5s and the second one has two 5s.

3. Apply basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. In this case, we don't need to apply any arithmetic operations as there are no numerical aspects involved in the transformation rules.

4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined. The main concept here is preserving the integrity of objects during transformations:
   - Object 1: [0, 5, 5, 5] -> [0, 5, 5, 0] (rotate object 90 degrees counter-clockwise)
   - Object 2: [0, 5, 5, 0] -> [0, 5, 0, 0] (translate object horizontally to the left)

5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one. Based on the transformations above, we can create the following output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
