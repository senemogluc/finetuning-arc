Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output:

1. Recognize that there are multiple objects in the grid, some with the same number (e.g., 2, 8). Identify these objects and their relationships.
2. Observe that there are no significant transformations or occlusions in this case; the objects appear to persist in a similar form throughout the grid.
3. Look for any tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can see that each object consists of two adjacent numbers (e.g., 2-2, 8-8). The only exception is the first object with the number 3.
4. Apply basic arithmetic to identify the goal or intention guiding the transformations. Since there are four objects with pairs of the same number and one object with a single number, we need to distribute these numbers evenly among the objects.
5. Distribute the numbers as follows:
   - For the first object (3), it will become 2-1 since it has a single number.
   - For the remaining objects with pairs of the same number, each pair will become two adjacent numbers with half of their original value (e.g., 2-2 becomes 1-1).
6. Apply these transformations to the input grid:

   Input:
     [3, 0, 0, 1]
     [0, 2, 2, 0]
     [0, 2, 2, 0]
     [3, 0, 0, 3]
     [0, 8, 8, 0]
     [8, 8, 8, 8]
     [8, 0, 0, 8]
     [8, 8, 8, 8]

   Output:
     [2, 0, 0, 1]
     [0, 1, 1, 0]
     [0, 1, 1, 0]
     [1, 0, 0, 3]
     [0, 4, 4, 0]
     [4, 4, 4, 4]
     [4, 0, 0, 4]
     [4, 4, 4, 4]

The output of the last input is:

  [2, 0, 0, 1]
  [0, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 4, 4, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]
