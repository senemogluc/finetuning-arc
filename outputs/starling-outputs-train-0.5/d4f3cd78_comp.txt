Here are the steps to find the transformation rule and generate the output grid for the last given input grid.

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on the priors:
   - Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
   - Objects are assumed to persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.

In the input grid, we can identify the following objects:
- A single object consisting of 5's (highlighted in blue) with a size of 3x3.
- The background (0's).

2. Analyze the transformation rule based on the priors:
   - Pay attention to object relationships, transformations, and persistence.
   - Implicitly identify goals or intentions guiding the transformations.
   - Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
   - Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined.

In this case, we can observe that the 5's object is a square with side length 3. Since there are no other objects or transformations involved, the transformation rule seems to be keeping the original shape and size of the object without any change.

3. Generate the output grid based on the identified transformation rule:
   - The output grid should have the same dimensions as the input grid (10x10).
   - Fill in the corresponding values from the original 5's object (3x3) while maintaining its position and size in the grid.
   - Add a single background (0's) object surrounding the 5's object with a distance of at least one cell.

Based on these steps, the output grid for the last given input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid follows the transformation rule and maintains the original shape and size of the 5's object while adding a single background object surrounding it.
