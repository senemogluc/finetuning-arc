To generate the output grid for the last given input grid, we will follow the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs.

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

We can observe that the numbers 8 are adjacent to each other and form an object. The number 2 is also part of an object with its neighboring 0s. We need to consider the transformation rule for physical contact between objects. Since there's no direct translation or rebounding happening in this case, we can focus on counting, sorting, and comparing the numbers and their sizes.

Using elementary geometry and topology concepts, we can determine that the 8s should be merged into a single object with twice the value (16), while the 2s will remain as they are. The 0s don't affect the transformation, so they can be ignored.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

So the output grid for the last given input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
