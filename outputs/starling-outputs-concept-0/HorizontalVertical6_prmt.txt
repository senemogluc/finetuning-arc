Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we can see that there are two types of objects in the input grid - squares with a value of 1 surrounded by zeros (0) and squares with a value of 0 surrounded by ones (1). The objects appear to be arranged in a checkerboard pattern.

2. Analyze object transformations: The objects seem to be moving horizontally or vertically, one step at a time, without rotating or changing shape. This can be seen as a translation of the objects within the grid.

3. Determine goals or intentions: Based on the input grids provided, it appears that the goal is to move all the squares with a value of 1 (surrounded by zeros) to the right side of the grid while maintaining their relative positions and the checkerboard pattern.

4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Counting the number of squares with a value of 1 in each row, we can see that there are 3 rows with 2 squares (1, 1), 3 rows with 1 square (1), and 3 rows with no squares (0).

5. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: The checkerboard pattern suggests a grid structure, which can be analyzed using basic geometric concepts such as rows, columns, and diagonals. In this case, the horizontal and vertical movements of the objects are consistent with the grid structure.

6. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that the transformation rule is moving all squares with a value of 1 (surrounded by zeros) to the right side of the grid while maintaining their relative positions and the checkerboard pattern.

7. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule works for all three provided input-output pairs, as it maintains the relative positions of the objects and the checkerboard pattern.
