Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid: There are two main objects - one with value 1 and another with value 7. The object with value 1 is connected horizontally, while the object with value 7 is connected both horizontally and vertically.
2. Apply transformation rules: Since there's no specific interaction or transformation between these two objects, we can simply copy them to the output grid without any change.
3. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule seems to work fine for all the previous cases.

Final Output Grid:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
