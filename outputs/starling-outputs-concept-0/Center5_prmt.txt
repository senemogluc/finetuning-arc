Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The input grid has no clear patterns or relationships between objects that can be leveraged to infer a transformation rule. 

However, if we consider the priors and reasoning from previous cases, we can attempt to create an output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is based on the assumption that objects with the same value are part of the same object and should be preserved in the output grid. However, this may not be a valid transformation rule for all cases, as it doesn't take into account the priors related to physical contact, counting, or sorting objects. 

It's important to note that without more context or information about the relationship between objects in the input grid, it's challenging to determine a specific and accurate transformation rule.
