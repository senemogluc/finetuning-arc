Based on the transformation rules and previous cases, the output for the last input grid should be:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]

This output grid maintains the same number of objects as in the input grid and follows the transformation rules provided.
