To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given cases and their transformations.

Case 0:
The input grid has a single object with value 3, which is repeated multiple times. The transformation rule seems to be rearranging the object while maintaining its shape and size.

Case 1:
The input grid has two objects with values 8 and 4. The transformation rule appears to be rotating these objects by 90 degrees and placing them in a new position.

Case 2:
The input grid has two objects with values 7 and 6. The transformation rule seems to be rearranging the objects while maintaining their shape and size, similar to Case 0. However, there is an additional step of rotating the object with value 7 by 90 degrees.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following transformation rules:

1. Rearrange objects while maintaining their shape and size.
2. Rotate objects by 90 degrees if necessary.
3. Place objects in a new position if required.

Now let's apply these rules to the last input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid is the same as the input grid. This means that no transformation rules were applied in this case. The objects are already arranged and positioned optimally, so there's no need for rearrangement or rotation.
