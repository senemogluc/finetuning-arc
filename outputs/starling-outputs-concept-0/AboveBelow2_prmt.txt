Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we can see that the 6's are arranged in a square pattern with 3x3 squares around them. The 0's are background elements that don't form any distinct objects.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are 4 6's in each row, and there are 3 rows of 6's. So, we have a total of 12 6's in the grid.
3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: The 6's form a square with side length 3. There are no holes or self-intersections in this arrangement.
4. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: We can see that the 6's are arranged in a square pattern, which is a stable and persistent configuration. The 0's don't form any distinct objects and can be considered as background elements.
5. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: This transformation rule works for all the given cases.
