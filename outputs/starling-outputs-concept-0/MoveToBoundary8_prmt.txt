Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have a single object with the number 7 in the top-left corner and another object formed by the numbers 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 at the bottom. The two objects are separated by an empty space.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There is no numerical aspect in this case that requires counting or basic arithmetic.
3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: In this case, there's a simple geometric relationship between the two objects - one object is above the other.
4. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule seems to work for all previous input-output pairs as well.
5. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid: In this case, the output grid is smaller than the input grid.

Final Output Grid:
