Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The input grid does not seem to follow any clear pattern or relationship between objects that can be leveraged to infer a transformation rule. 

However, if we consider the last input grid as a standalone case:

Input:
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

This output is simply a mirror image of the input grid along the vertical axis.
