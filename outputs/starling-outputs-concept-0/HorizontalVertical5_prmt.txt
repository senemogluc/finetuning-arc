Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a unique transformation rule for this specific case. The pattern in the input grid does not clearly indicate any specific transformation rule that can be applied consistently across all cases. 

However, if we consider the presence of the number 4 in the grid, we could try to transform the grid by moving the 4s horizontally or vertically while maintaining their relative positions. Here's one possible output:

Output:
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
