Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies universally. However, we can try to analyze each case individually and make an educated guess for the output grid. 

For Case 3, with the input grid being [7, 5, 4], there are no clear relationships between the numbers or any apparent transformations. It's also not evident that there is a specific goal or intention guiding the transformation. 

Given this information, it's challenging to generate an output grid for Case 3 without more context or a defined rule.
