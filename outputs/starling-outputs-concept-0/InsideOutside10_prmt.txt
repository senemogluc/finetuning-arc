Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to be preserving the structure of the grid and maintaining the same numbers adjacent to each other. The only change in this case is the removal of all zeros from the input grid, which doesn't seem to follow any specific pattern or transformation rule. Therefore, I will consider the output grid as the same as the input grid for Case 0.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:
In this case, the transformation rule seems to be preserving the structure of the grid and maintaining the same numbers adjacent to each other. The only change in this case is the removal of all zeros from the input grid, which doesn't seem to follow any specific pattern or transformation rule. Therefore, I will consider the output grid as the same as the input grid for Case 1.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
In this case, the transformation rule seems to be preserving the structure of the grid and maintaining the same numbers adjacent to each other. The only change in this case is the removal of all zeros from the input grid, which doesn't seem to follow any specific pattern or transformation rule. Therefore, I will consider the output grid as the same as the input grid for Case 2.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
