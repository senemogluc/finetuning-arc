Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input without more context or specific goals. Here are some possible outputs based on different interpretations of the rules:

1. If we consider the 8s as a single object and the 9s as another object, we can have the following output:

   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. If we consider the 8s and 9s as part of a single object, we can have the following output:

   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

3. If we consider the 8s and 9s as separate objects but don't focus on their specific arrangement, we can have the following output:

   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

These are just a few possible outputs based on different interpretations of the rules. To determine the correct output, more context or specific goals need to be provided.
