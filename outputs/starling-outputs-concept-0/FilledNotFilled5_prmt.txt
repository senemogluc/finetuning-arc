Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The input grid has a different structure compared to the previous cases, with no clear pattern or relationship between the numbers. 

However, we can try to apply some basic transformations to see if any of them produce a meaningful output:

1. Rotate the entire grid by 90 degrees clockwise:
   This transformation doesn't seem to create a meaningful pattern in the output grid.

2. Reflect the entire grid along the vertical axis:
   This transformation also doesn't create a meaningful pattern in the output grid.

3. Swap the positions of 4 and 0 in the grid:
   This transformation results in the following output grid:
   
   Output:
     [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
     [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
     [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This transformation creates a more organized pattern in the output grid compared to the previous attempts. However, it's important to note that this is just one possible transformation, and there might be other valid transformations as well. 

In conclusion, the output of the last input grid using the given priors and previous cases can be:

   [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
   [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
   [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
   [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
