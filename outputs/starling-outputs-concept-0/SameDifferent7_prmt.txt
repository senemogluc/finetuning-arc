Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we can see that the numbers are grouped together in columns and rows. The 0s form a background around these groups of numbers.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are 3 columns with the same pattern of 4, 6, and 4. We can count the number of occurrences for each number in these columns to determine if there's any transformation rule.
3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: The grid is a 2D array, so we don't need to consider any complex geometric or topological transformations.
4. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: Based on the counting results, it seems that there are no specific transformations happening with the numbers themselves. They appear to be copied from one grid to another.
5. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule holds true for all the previous input-output pairs as well.
6. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid: In this case, the output grid is the same size as the input grid.
7. Final output grid:
