Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The input grid has a pattern where the numbers are arranged in columns. The transformation rule can be applied by preserving the columns and removing any empty rows or columns.

Output:
  [6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 0, 6, 3, 0, 6, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:

The input grid has a pattern where the numbers are arranged in rows and columns. The transformation rule can be applied by preserving the rows and columns with non-zero values and removing any empty rows or columns.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [4, 0, 1, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:

The input grid has a pattern where the numbers are arranged in rows and columns. The transformation rule can be applied by preserving the rows and columns with non-zero values and removing any empty rows or columns.

Output:
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
