Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to be about preserving the structure of objects with the same number adjacent to each other. The background (value 0) is removed, and the remaining objects are preserved in their original positions.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:
The transformation rule seems to be about preserving the structure of objects with the same number adjacent to each other and removing any noise or occlusion. The background (value 0) is removed, and the remaining objects are preserved in their original positions.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
The transformation rule seems to be about preserving the structure of objects with the same number adjacent to each other and removing any noise or occlusion. The background (value 0) is removed, and the remaining objects are preserved in their original positions.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In all three cases, the transformation rule is about preserving the structure of objects with the same number adjacent to each other and removing any noise or occlusion. The background (value 0) is removed, and the remaining objects are preserved in their original positions.
