Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships:
   - The 7s form a square shape with a 2 in the center, surrounded by 5s.
   - The 2s are connected to the 5s, forming a rectangle shape.
   - The 0s act as background or separators between these objects.

2. Analyze object transformations and persistence:
   - The square of 7s remains intact, with the 2 in the center.
   - The rectangle of 5s also remains intact.

3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects:
   - There are no specific counting or sorting tasks in this case.

4. Apply basic arithmetic and geometric concepts:
   - The square of 7s has an area of 7 * 7 = 49, while the rectangle of 5s has an area of 5 * 5 = 25.

5. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs:
   - The transformation rule seems to work for the given input-output pairs.

Based on these steps and reasoning, the output grid should be:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
