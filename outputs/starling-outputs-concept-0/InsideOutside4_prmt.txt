Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify and group adjacent objects with the same value (e.g., 8). This will help us recognize and apply transformations to these groups later on. In this case, we have two main groups of 8s: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0].

2. Identify the transformations that can be applied to these groups. In this case, we can apply a horizontal shift transformation to both groups:
   - For the first group, we can shift it one position to the right: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
   - For the second group, we can shift it two positions to the right: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. Note that the 6 in the original grid is replaced by a 4 in the transformed grid.

3. Apply these transformations to the input grid:
   - For the first group, we can shift it one position to the right: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
   - For the second group, we can shift it two positions to the right: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. Note that the 6 in the original grid is replaced by a 4 in the transformed grid.

4. Combine these transformations with the original grid:
   - [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

So, the output of the last input is:

  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
