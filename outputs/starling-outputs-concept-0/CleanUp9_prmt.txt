To determine the transformation rule for the given cases, we can analyze the patterns and relationships between objects in each case. Here's a summary of the observations:

1. In Case 0, there are no distinct objects with the same number adjacent to each other. The output grid is an all-zero grid, which could be interpreted as removing all objects from the input grid.
2. In Case 1, there are two distinct objects with the same number (5 and 6) adjacent to each other. The transformation rule seems to merge these objects into a single object with the maximum value of the merged objects (5 and 6 become 5). The output grid is an all-zero grid, which could be interpreted as removing all objects from the input grid.
3. In Case 2, there are no distinct objects with the same number adjacent to each other. However, we can observe that the numbers in the input grid form a pattern of increasing and decreasing values along both rows and columns. The transformation rule for this case could be to sort the numbers in ascending order along both rows and columns.

Based on these observations, I will generate the output grid for the last input using the transformation rule induced from Case 2:

Input:
  [0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 9]
  [4, 1, 1, 7, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9]
  [0, 1, 1, 7, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0]

The output grid is generated by sorting the numbers in ascending order along both rows and columns.
