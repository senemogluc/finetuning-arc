Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule for this case involves recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. The input grid has a pattern where there are four 4's in each row, followed by a 0, and then three 3's.

To apply the transformation rule, we need to count the number of 4's and 3's in each row and place them accordingly in the output grid. Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Count the number of 4's and 3's in each row of the input grid.
2. Place the 4's in the first column of the output grid, followed by a 0, and then place the 3's in the second column of the output grid.
3. Repeat this process for all rows in the input grid.

Following these steps, we get the following output grid:

Output:
[4, 4, 4, 0]
[4, 4, 4, 0]
[0, 3, 3, 3]
[0, 3, 3, 3]

This output grid represents the transformation applied to the last input grid based on the inferred transformation rule.
