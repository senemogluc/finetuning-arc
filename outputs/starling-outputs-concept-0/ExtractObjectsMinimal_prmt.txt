Case 3:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To determine the output grid for this input, we can apply the transformation rule based on the priors:

1. Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
2. Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. In many cases, objects from the input persist in a transformed form on the output grid.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. This may include translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements.
4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
5. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
6. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined.
7. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one.
8. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs.
9. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid.

In this case, we have two objects with the number 7 adjacent to each other in the input grid. These two objects will likely persist in a transformed form in the output grid. There is no physical contact between these objects, and no counting or sorting tasks are involved. The transformation rule does not provide specific guidance for this situation, so we can infer that the output grid should maintain the same structure as the input grid, with the two 7s still adjacent to each other.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
