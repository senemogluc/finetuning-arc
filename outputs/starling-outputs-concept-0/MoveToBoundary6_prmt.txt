Here's the reasoning for each case:

Case 0: The transformation rule seems to involve removing all instances of the number 4 from the grid. This can be seen in both the input and output grids, as all occurrences of 4 have been replaced with 0.

Case 1: Similar to Case 0, the transformation rule involves removing all instances of a specific number (in this case, 0) from the grid. Again, we can see that all occurrences of 0 have been replaced with 1 in the output grid.

Case 2: In this case, the transformation rule seems to involve replacing all instances of a specific number (in this case, 4) with another number (in this case, 1). This is evident from the input and output grids, where all occurrences of 4 have been replaced with 1.

Case 3: The transformation rule in this case seems to involve replacing all instances of a specific number (in this case, 0) with another number (in this case, 1). This can be seen in the input and output grids, where all occurrences of 0 have been replaced with 1.

Case 4: Similar to Case 2, the transformation rule involves replacing all instances of a specific number (in this case, 4) with another number (in this case, 1). This is evident from the input and output grids, where all occurrences of 4 have been replaced with 1.

For the last input grid:

Input:
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
