Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid:
   - Object A: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
   - Object B: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
   - Object C: [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0] (same as B)
   - Object D: [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0] (same as B and C)
   - Object E: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0] (same as A)
   - Object F: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object G: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]
   - Object H: [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5] (same as G)
   - Object I: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5] (same as G)

2. Apply the transformation rule:
   - Object A and E are adjacent and have the same color, so they merge into a single object J with values [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0].
   - Object B, C, and D are also adjacent and have the same color, so they merge into a single object K with values [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0].
   - Object G and H are adjacent and have the same color, so they merge into a single object L with values [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5].

3. The final output grid after applying the transformation rule:
   - Object J: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
   - Object K: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
   - Object L: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]
   - Object F: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
