Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The pattern in the input grid doesn't seem to follow any clear rules or relationships between objects. As a result, it's not possible to generate an output grid that corresponds to the last given input grid using the induced transformation rule from previous cases.

Here are some observations about the last input grid:

1. There are several instances of the number 6 and 8 appearing in the grid.
2. The grid has a rectangular shape with a central block of 0s.
3. Some numbers (e.g., 4, 7) appear only once in the grid, while others (e.g., 6, 8) appear multiple times.
4. There are no apparent patterns or relationships between the numbers that can be used to infer a transformation rule.

Given these observations and the lack of clear relationships between objects, it's not possible to generate an output grid for this case using the induced transformation rule from previous cases.
