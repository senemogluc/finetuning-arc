Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The input grid has a repeating pattern with two main objects (2 and 3) and one background object (0). The transformation rule should maintain this pattern. Since the last given input is just a repetition of the first few rows, we can apply the same transformation rule to obtain the output grid.

Case 1:
The input grid has a repeating pattern with two main objects (4 and 8) and one background object (0). The transformation rule should maintain this pattern. Since the last given input is just a repetition of the first few rows, we can apply the same transformation rule to obtain the output grid.

Case 2:
The input grid has a repeating pattern with three main objects (1, 4, and 6) and one background object (0). The transformation rule should maintain this pattern. Since the last given input is just a repetition of the first few rows, we can apply the same transformation rule to obtain the output grid.

For all cases, the output grids are as follows:

Case 0 Output:
