Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent numbers:
   - Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object 4: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5]
   - Object 5: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5]
   - Object 6: [6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6]
   - Object 7: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5]
   - Object 8: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5]

2. Apply the transformation rule based on object relationships and persistence:
   - Move Object 3 to the right by one position, merging with Object 4:
     [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 5]
   - Move Object 2 to the right by one position, merging with Object 4:
     [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Move Object 6 to the right by one position, merging with Object 5:
     [6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6] becomes [11, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 6]
   - Move Object 5 to the right by one position, merging with Object 7:
     [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5] becomes [10, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 5]
   - Move Object 8 to the right by one position, merging with Object 7:
     [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5] becomes [10, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 5]

3. The final output grid is:
   [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 5]
   [0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 6]
   [0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 5]
