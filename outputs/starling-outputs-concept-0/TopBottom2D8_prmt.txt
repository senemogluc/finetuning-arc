Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to be about preserving the same numbers that are adjacent to each other. The grid has two main objects, one with number 2 and another with number 3. Both objects persist throughout the grid. The output is obtained by replacing all instances of 3 with 2.

Case 1:
The transformation rule seems to be about preserving the same numbers that are adjacent to each other. There are two main objects, one with number 5 and another with number 4. Both objects persist throughout the grid. The output is obtained by replacing all instances of 4 with 5.

Case 2:
The transformation rule seems to be about preserving the same numbers that are adjacent to each other. There are two main objects, one with number 8 and another with number 6. Both objects persist throughout the grid. The output is obtained by replacing all instances of 6 with 8.

Case 3:
The transformation rule seems to be about preserving the same numbers that are adjacent to each other. There are two main objects, one with number 8 and another with number 6. Both objects persist throughout the grid. The output is obtained by replacing all instances of 6 with 8.

For the last input in Case 3:

Input:
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
