Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have three main objects - a 5x5 square in the center, and two 5x0 rectangles on the left and right sides. The 5x5 square is surrounded by these two rectangles.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are no numerical aspects to consider in this case.
3. Recognize elementary geometry and topology concepts: The main object (the 5x5 square) has a clear geometric shape, while the surrounding objects have different shapes (rectangles).
4. Check whether the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule seems to work well for all previous cases.

Based on these steps and reasoning, here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
