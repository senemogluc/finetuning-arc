Based on the given priors and previous cases, it seems that the transformation rule involves preserving the same-colored objects and their positions while ignoring any noise or occlusion. In this case, the input grid has only one object with color 5, which is a rectangle formed by the 5s in each row. The output grid should preserve this rectangle without any changes:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
