Based on the given priors and previous transformations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, it seems like the objects are arranged in a specific pattern with numbers 0-6. The pattern is as follows:

[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6]

The pattern is a 3x3 grid of 8s with a 2x1 grid of 0s at the bottom. The numbers 0-6 are arranged in a diagonal pattern within the 2x1 grid. To obtain the output grid, we can shift the entire grid one position to the right:

Output:
  [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6]
  [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6]
  [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6]

This output grid follows the same pattern as the input grid, but with a one-position shift to the right.
