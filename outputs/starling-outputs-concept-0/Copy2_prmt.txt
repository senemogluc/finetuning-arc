Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. The numbers in the grid are arranged in a way that forms a pattern, with 8s surrounding the 2s and 4s. The 8s seem to be part of a larger structure, while the 2s and 4s are smaller structures within it.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 4, 2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:
The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. The numbers in the grid are arranged in a way that forms a pattern, with 6s surrounding the 1s and 8s. The 8s seem to be part of a larger structure, while the 1s are smaller structures within it.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 1, 1, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 1, 6, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 1, 1, 1, 6, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 1, 6, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. The numbers in the grid are arranged in a way that forms a pattern, with 8s surrounding the 3s and 0s. The 8s seem to be part of a larger structure, while the 3s and 0s are smaller structures within it.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

After analyzing the transformation rules for each case, I can provide the output grid for the last input:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8,
