Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The input grid has no clear patterns or relationships between objects that can be leveraged to infer a transformation rule. 

However, if we consider the presence of the number 5 in the grid, we could try to find a pattern by moving these numbers horizontally:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This transformation rule moves the number 5 horizontally to the right in each row. However, this is just one possible interpretation and may not be the intended transformation rule for this case.
