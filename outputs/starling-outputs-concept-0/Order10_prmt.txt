Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves identifying objects with the same number adjacent to each other and grouping them together. In this case, the last input grid has several groups of 2s and 4s.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation:

1. Identify groups of the same numbers adjacent to each other.
2. Group the numbers together in a single object.
3. Remove any noise or occlusion between objects, if present.
4. Transform the objects based on their interactions with other objects (e.g., translation, rebounding).
5. Count and sort the objects based on their numerical values.
6. Apply basic arithmetic to identify relationships between objects.
7. Recognize geometric and topological concepts related to the objects' shapes and sizes.
8. Output the transformed grid with the same dimensions as the input grid or a smaller grid containing only the relevant objects.

Applying these steps to the last input grid, we get the following output:

  [2, 4, 6, 8]
