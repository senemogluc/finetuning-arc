Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same numbers:
   - Object 1: [9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
   - Object 2: [9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9]
   - Object 3: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9]
   - Object 4: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]
   - Object 5: [9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
   - Object 6: [9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9]

2. Apply the transformation rule based on priors:
   - Persistence of objects despite noise or occlusion: All objects persist in their transformed forms.
   - Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: There is no direct physical contact between objects in this case.
   - Counting and basic arithmetic: No specific counting or arithmetic operations are needed for this transformation.
   - Elementary geometry and topology concepts: The main concept applied here is the preservation of the shape and size of each object while transforming them.

3. Transform objects based on the identified priors:
   - Object 1: [9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0] -> [5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0] (subtract 4 from each number)
   - Object 2: [9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9] -> [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5] (subtract 4 from each number)
   - Object 3: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9] -> [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5] (subtract 4 from each number)
   - Object 4: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0] (subtract 4 from each number)
   - Object 5: [9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0] -> [5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0] (subtract 4 from each number)
   - Object 6: [9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9] -> [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5] (subtract 4 from each number)

4. Combine the transformed objects to form the output grid:

   Output:
      [5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]
      [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]
      [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5]
      [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]
      [5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]
      [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]

The output grid for the last input is:

  [5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]
  [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]
