Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the output grid should be formed by grouping adjacent numbers with the same value. In this case, the input grid has a single number (3) in the middle, surrounded by zeros. 

Output:
  [3]

This output represents the transformation of the last given input grid according to the induced transformation rule.
