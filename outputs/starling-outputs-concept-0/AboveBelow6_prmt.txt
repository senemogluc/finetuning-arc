Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have a 3x3 grid with the same number (3) in all its cells. There are also two 2x2 grids with the same number (2) in all its cells. The 3x3 grid is connected to the left side of the 2x2 grid, and the other 2x2 grid is connected to the right side of the 3x3 grid.

2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are no numerical aspects or tasks involving counting or sorting objects in this case.

3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: The main transformation here is the rotation of the 3x3 grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise, which results in a new 3x3 grid with the same number (2) in all its cells. This rotation is consistent with the presence of physical contact between objects, as the 3x3 grid is rotated around the center of mass of the connected 2x2 grids.

4. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule works for both Case 1 and Case 2, as it correctly identifies the objects, their relationships, and the transformations that occurred between the input and output grids.

Final Output Grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
