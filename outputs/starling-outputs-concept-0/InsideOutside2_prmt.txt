Based on the given priors and previous input-output pairs, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies to all cases. However, I can provide an analysis for each case separately:

Case 1:
The input grid has two objects with values 2 and 4. The output grid has the same structure as the input grid but with the values rearranged. The 2 in the input grid is moved to the position of the 4, and the 4 is moved to the position of the 2. This transformation rule can be applied to other cases as well, where objects are swapped or rearranged within the grid.

Case 2:
The input grid has two objects with values 2 and 4. The output grid has the same structure as the input grid but with the values rearranged. The 2 in the input grid is moved to the position of the 4, and the 4 is moved to the position of the 2. This transformation rule can be applied to other cases as well, where objects are swapped or rearranged within the grid.

Case 3:
The input grid has two objects with values 2 and 4. The output grid has the same structure as the input grid but with the values rearranged. The 2 in the input grid is moved to the position of the 4, and the 4 is moved to the position of the 2. This transformation rule can be applied to other cases as well, where objects are swapped or rearranged within the grid.

Case 4:
The input grid has two objects with values 2 and 4. The output grid has the same structure as the input grid but with the values rearranged. The 2 in the input grid is moved to the position of the 4, and the 4 is moved to the position of the 2. This transformation rule can be applied to other cases as well, where objects are swapped or rearranged within the grid.

In conclusion, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies to all cases. However, based on the analysis of each case separately, a possible transformation rule is to swap or rearrange the values of adjacent objects within the grid.
