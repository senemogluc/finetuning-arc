Based on the given priors and previous input-output pairs, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies universally. However, I can provide an analysis of each case and suggest a possible transformation for the last input. 

Case 1:
The transformation seems to be moving objects horizontally or vertically while preserving their shape and color. For example, the 2s in the input are moved from the left side to the right side, and the 4 is moved down one row. 

Case 2:
In this case, it appears that the transformation involves moving objects diagonally or rotating them by 90 degrees while preserving their shape and color. For example, the 2s in the input are rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, and the 4 is moved diagonally down and to the right.

Case 3:
Here, the transformation seems to be moving objects horizontally or vertically while preserving their shape and color. For example, the 2s in the input are moved from the top row to the bottom row, and the 4 is moved left one column.

Case 4:
In this case, it appears that the transformation involves moving objects diagonally or rotating them by 90 degrees while preserving their shape and color. For example, the 2s in the input are rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, and the 4 is moved diagonally down and to the right.

Based on these observations, a possible transformation for the last input (Case 4) could be:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

However, it's important to note that this is just one possible transformation based on the analysis of previous cases. The actual transformation rule might be different or more complex.
