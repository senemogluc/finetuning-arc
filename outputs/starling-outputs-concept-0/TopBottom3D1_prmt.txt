Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid:
   - Object A: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object B: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0] (occurs twice)

2. Apply the transformation rule:
   - Object A is a single object with no transformations or interactions with other objects. It remains unchanged.
   - Object B has a physical contact interaction with itself, as it occurs twice in the grid. The two instances of Object B merge into one larger object.

3. Combine the transformed objects to create the output grid:
   - Output Grid: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] with merged Object B instances as follows:
     [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
     [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

The output grid for the last input is:
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
