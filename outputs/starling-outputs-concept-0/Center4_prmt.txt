Here's my reasoning for each case:

Case 0: The input grid has no transformations or interactions between objects. The output grid is the same as the input grid.

Case 1: The input grid has a pattern of 6s and 7s, with some noise in the form of 2s. The transformation rule should recognize this pattern and remove the noise while preserving the main pattern. The output grid removes the 2s and retains the 6s and 7s.

Case 2: The input grid has a pattern of 2s, with an interaction between two objects (8). The transformation rule should recognize this pattern and transform the 8 into a 0, preserving the main pattern. The output grid transforms the 8 into a 0, retaining the original pattern.

Case 3: The input grid has a pattern of 3s, with some noise in the form of 4. The transformation rule should recognize this pattern and remove the noise while preserving the main pattern. The output grid removes the 4 and retains the 3s.

For the last input (Case 3), the output grid is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
