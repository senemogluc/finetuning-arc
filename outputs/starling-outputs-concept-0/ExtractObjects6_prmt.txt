Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent numbers with the same value. In this case, we have several objects with values 1, 8, and 4.
2. Apply the transformation rule that objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. This means that even if some parts of an object are covered by another object, the original object still exists.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we have 4 objects with value 1, 2 objects with value 8, and 1 object with value 4.
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. We can count the number of occurrences of each value in the input grid:
   - Value 1 appears 4 times: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]
   - Value 8 appears 2 times: [(1, 1), (1, 2)]
   - Value 4 appears 1 time: [(7, 6)]
5. Based on the counting and basic arithmetic, we can create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, where each object is represented by its original value:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [7, 7, 5, 5, 7]
  [7, 7, 5, 5, 7]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

The output grid for the last input is:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [7, 7, 5, 5, 7]
  [7, 7, 5, 5, 7]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
