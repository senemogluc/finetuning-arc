Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The input grid does not seem to follow any clear pattern or relationship between adjacent numbers that would allow us to infer a transformation rule. 

However, we can still try to generate an output grid based on some assumptions:

1. Treat each number as a separate object.
2. Preserve the position of each number in the input grid.
3. If two numbers are adjacent and have the same value, merge them into a single object.

Using these assumptions, we can generate the following output grid for the last input:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that this output grid is based on assumptions and might not be the correct one for the given transformation rule.
