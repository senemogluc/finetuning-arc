Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid: There are two main objects in the grid - one with value 2 and another with value 3. The object with value 2 is a square, while the object with value 3 forms a rectangle.
2. Apply transformation rules: The rectangle object with value 3 has a consistent shape and size throughout the grid. The square object with value 2 also maintains its shape and size consistently. There are no tasks involving physical contact or counting/sorting objects in this case.
3. Determine the output grid based on the identified objects and their transformations: Since both objects maintain their shapes and sizes, we can simply copy them to the output grid without any changes.
4. Check if the transformation works for previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule holds true for all previous cases as well.

Final Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
