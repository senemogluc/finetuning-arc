Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid: There are three main objects - a large object with value 6, and two smaller objects with value 0. The large object is surrounded by the smaller ones.
2. Apply transformation rule: Since there's no physical contact between objects, we can simply remove the smaller objects (value 0) from the grid.
3. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: Yes, it does.

Final Output Grid:

[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
