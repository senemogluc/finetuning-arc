Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule is to keep objects with the same number adjacent to each other in the same group. The background (0) is not considered an object. There are no transformations or persistence of objects, as the input grid is already a single object. Therefore, the output grid remains the same as the input grid.

Case 1:
The transformation rule is to keep objects with the same number adjacent to each other in the same group. The background (0) is not considered an object. There are no transformations or persistence of objects, as the input grid is already a single object. Therefore, the output grid remains the same as the input grid.

Case 2:
The transformation rule is to keep objects with the same number adjacent to each other in the same group. The background (0) is not considered an object. There are no transformations or persistence of objects, as the input grid is already a single object. Therefore, the output grid remains the same as the input grid.

For all three cases, the transformation rule does not require any changes to be made to the input grids. As a result, the output grids are identical to the input grids:
