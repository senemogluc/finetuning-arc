Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The input grid has no clear patterns or relationships between the numbers that can be leveraged to infer a transformation rule. 

However, we can still try to generate an output grid based on some assumptions:

1. Treat each number as a separate object.
2. Preserve the position of each number in the input grid.
3. If two adjacent numbers are the same, merge them into a single object.

Using these assumptions, we can create the following output grid:

Output:
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that this output grid is based on assumptions and may not be the correct transformation rule for the given input.
