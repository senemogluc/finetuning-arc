Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The grid consists of only one object with value 3. The transformation rule doesn't change the structure or values, so the output should be the same as the input.

Case 1:
There are two objects in this grid: one with value 2 and another with value 1. The transformation rule doesn't change the structure or values, so the output should be the same as the input.

Case 2:
The grid consists of two objects: one with value 8 and another with value 7. The transformation rule doesn't change the structure or values, so the output should be the same as the input.

Case 3:
The grid consists of three objects: one with value 6 and two with value 3. The transformation rule doesn't change the structure or values, so the output should be the same as the input.

Based on the reasoning above, the output for the last input (Case 3) is:

  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 3]
  [6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 3]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
