Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same numbers:
   - Object 1: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8] (surrounded by zeros)
   - Object 2: [7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0] (surrounded by zeros and object 1)
   - Object 3: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0] (surrounded by zeros and object 1)
   - Object 4: [8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 8] (surrounded by zeros and object 1)
   - Object 5: [7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0] (surrounded by zeros, object 2, and object 4)
   - Object 6: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0] (surrounded by zeros, object 3, and object 5)
   - Object 7: [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0] (surrounded by zeros, object 6, and object 4)
   - Object 8: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0] (surrounded by zeros and object 6)

2. Apply counting or sorting tasks if necessary:
   - No specific counting or sorting tasks are present in the input grid.

3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts:
   - Objects are mostly rectangular, with some irregular shapes due to the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects.

4. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs:
   - The transformation rule seems to work for all given cases.

Based on the reasoning above, here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8]
  [0, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 8]
  [0, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
