Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same numbers:
   - Object 1: [7, 7, 7] (top row)
   - Object 2: [7, 3, 7] (middle row)
   - Object 3: [7, 7, 7] (bottom row)
   - Object 4: [1, 0, 0] (right column)

2. Apply the transformation rule considering object relationships and persistence:
   - Object 1 and 3 are identical and persistent, so they can be merged horizontally to form a single object with the same shape and size.
   - Object 2 is also persistent but has a different shape than the other objects. It cannot be merged with any of the other objects directly. However, it can be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise to match the orientation of the merged object from step 3.
   - Object 4 is not part of any transformation and remains unchanged.

3. Apply the transformation:
   - Merge Object 1 and 3 horizontally: [7, 7, 7, 7]
   - Rotate Object 2 by 90 degrees clockwise: [7, 0, 7]

4. Combine all transformed objects:
   - Output grid: [7, 7, 7, 7]
                  [7, 0, 7]
                  [1, 0, 0]

So, the output of the last input is:

  [7, 7, 7, 7]
  [7, 0, 7]
  [1, 0, 0]
