Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we can see that there are several instances of the number 8 in the input grid. They appear as a single object with no other objects adjacent to them. These 8s are connected horizontally and vertically.

2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are 10 instances of the number 8 in the grid, and they form a rectangle shape. The dimensions of this rectangle are 5x2.

3. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: Since the 8s form a rectangle, we can consider them as a single object with no internal structure or connections between the 8s. This means that when transforming the grid, the 8s will maintain their shape and position relative to each other.

4. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that the transformation rule is to preserve the rectangle of 8s while applying any necessary translations or rotations to match the input grid's structure.

5. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule holds for all three cases provided.
