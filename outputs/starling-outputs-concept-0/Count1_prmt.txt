Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific output for the last input without more context or information about the relationship between objects. However, I can provide an analysis of the input and suggest a possible output based on the provided priors:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Possible Output:
  [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output assumes that the two occurrences of the number 1 are part of the same object and transform into a single object with the value 4. However, without more context or information about the relationship between objects in the input, it's impossible to determine the exact output with certainty.
