Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The pattern in the input grid does not seem to follow any clear rules or relationships between objects that can be leveraged to create a consistent transformation rule. 

However, if we consider the last input grid as a standalone case, we can try to identify patterns and apply transformations accordingly:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the output grid is a mirror image of the input grid along the vertical axis. This transformation rule can be applied consistently to all previous cases as well, resulting in the same output grids for each case.
