Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The input grid does not seem to follow any clear pattern or relationship between objects that can be leveraged to create an output grid. 

However, if we consider the last input grid as Case 3:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 7, 6, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 6, 7, 6, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

A possible output grid could be:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

However, this is just one possible interpretation of the input grid. Without more context or a clear transformation rule, it's difficult to determine a specific output grid for this case.
