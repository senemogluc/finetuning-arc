To determine the transformation rule for the given cases, we can analyze the patterns and relationships between objects in each case. Here's a breakdown of the rules for each case:

Case 0:
- The grid consists of alternating rows of 4s and 3s.
- The transformation rule is to keep the same pattern of alternating rows, with no changes to the objects themselves.

Case 1:
- The grid consists of a repeating pattern of 7s, 2s, and 5s.
- The transformation rule is to maintain the same pattern of these objects in each row, without any changes to their positions or values.

Case 2:
- The grid alternates between rows of 1s and rows with a mix of 0s and 7s.
- The transformation rule is to keep the same pattern of alternating rows of 1s and mixed 0s and 7s, without any changes to the objects themselves.

Now, let's apply these rules to the last input grid (Case 2):

Input:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]

Output:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]

The output grid for the last input is:

  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
