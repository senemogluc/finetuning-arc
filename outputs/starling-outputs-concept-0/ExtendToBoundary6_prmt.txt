Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
- The input grid has two separate objects with value 2.
- The transformation rule states that objects are assumed to persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. So, we can keep the two objects as they are in the output grid.
- However, there is a single object with value 1 in the input grid. We need to find its position relative to the adjacent objects and place it accordingly in the output grid.
- The transformation rule also states that recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can count the number of objects with value 2 and place the object with value 1 between them.

Output:
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:
- The input grid has two separate objects with value 2.
- Similar to Case 0, we can keep the two objects as they are in the output grid.
- There is a single object with value 1 in the input grid. We need to find its position relative to the adjacent objects and place it accordingly in the output grid.
- The transformation rule also states that recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can count the number of objects with value 2 and place the object with value 1 between them.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
- The input grid has two separate objects with value 2.
- Similar to Case 0 and Case 1, we can keep the two objects as they are in the output grid.
- There is a single object with value 1 in the input grid. We need to find its position relative to the adjacent objects and place it accordingly in the output grid.
- The transformation rule also states that recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can count the number of objects with value 2 and place the object with value 1 between them.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 3:
- The input grid has two separate objects with value 2.
- Similar to Case 0, Case 1, and Case 2, we can keep the two objects as they are in the output grid.
- There is a single object with value 1 in the input grid. We need to find its position relative to the adjacent objects and place it accordingly in the output grid.
- The transformation rule also states that recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can count the number of objects with value 2 and place the object with value 1 between them.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 4:
- The input grid has a single object with value 2.
- Similar to Case 0, Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, we can keep the object as it is in the output grid.
- However, there are two objects with value 1 in the input grid. We need to find their positions relative to the adjacent objects and place them accordingly in the output grid.
- The transformation rule also states that recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can count the number of objects with value 2 and place the two objects with value 1 between them.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
