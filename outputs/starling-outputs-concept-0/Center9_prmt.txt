Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on adjacent numbers with the same value. In this case, we have three objects: [0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 8, 3], and [0, 3].
2. Apply the transformation rule by preserving the structure of these objects while considering their relationships, transformations, and persistence. In this case, we can maintain the same structure as there are no significant interactions or changes in the input grid.
3. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs. It does, so we can proceed with the output grid.
4. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid. In this case, it's the same size as the input grid.

Final Output Grid:
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 3]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
