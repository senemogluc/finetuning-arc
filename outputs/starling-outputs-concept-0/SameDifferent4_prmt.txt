Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on the same number rule:
   - Object A: [3, 3, 3, 3] (top left)
   - Object B: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] (middle column)
   - Object C: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0] (bottom row)

2. Apply the transformation rule based on object relationships and persistence:
   - Object A remains unchanged as it is a single object with no interactions or transformations.
   - Object B has a translation along the vertical axis by one position to the right. The 5 in the middle of the object is replaced by a 0, indicating that the object has moved.
   - Object C also translates along the horizontal axis by one position to the left. The 7s are preserved as they are part of the same object.

3. Combine the transformed objects into the output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
