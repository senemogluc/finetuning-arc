Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on adjacent numbers:
   - Object 1: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
   - Object 2: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
   - Object 3: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
   - Object 4: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
   - Object 5: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]
   - Object 6: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]
   - Object 7: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
   - Object 8: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]

2. Apply the transformation rule based on object relationships and persistence:
   - Objects 1 and 2 are adjacent and have the same value; merge them into a single object with values [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0].
   - Objects 3 and 4 are also adjacent and have the same value; merge them into a single object with values [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0].
   - Objects 5 and 6 are adjacent and have the same value; merge them into a single object with values [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0].

3. The remaining objects (7 and 8) don't have any adjacent objects with the same value, so they remain unchanged.

4. Combine the merged objects to form the output grid:
   [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
