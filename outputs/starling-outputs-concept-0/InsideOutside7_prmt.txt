Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, it seems like the grid represents a collection of objects with different numbers associated with them. The goal is to identify groups of objects with the same number and count them.

For the last input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0]
  [8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]

We can identify the following groups of objects with the same number:

- Group 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - Count: 6
- Group 2: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] - Count: 5
- Group 3: [8, 8, 8, 8] - Count: 4

Now, we can create the output grid by placing these groups in a way that represents their counts:

Output:
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0]
  [8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify groups of objects with the same number in the input grid.
2. Count the number of objects in each group.
3. Create an output grid that represents the counts of each group.
4. Ensure that the transformation rule works on previous input-output pairs (which it does).
5. The output grid can be larger or smaller than the input grid, as long as it represents the counts of each group.
