Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid: There are two main objects - a group of 8s and a single 0. The 8s form a square shape, while the 0s are scattered around.
2. Apply transformation rules: Since the 8s form a square shape, we can consider them as a single object. The 0s are not part of any object and remain separate.
3. Check for physical contact or interactions between objects: There is no interaction between the 8s and the 0s, so they maintain their original positions.
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Count the number of 8s in the grid - there are 4.
5. Write down reasoning for each option: The transformation rule involves recognizing objects and maintaining their positions while considering them as a single object.
6. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs: Yes, it does.
