Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input without more context or specific goals. However, I can provide an analysis of the input and suggest some possible outputs based on different interpretations of the transformation rules.

Here are two possible outputs based on different interpretations:

Output 1 (Focusing on objects with same number):
  [0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [7, 1, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output 2 (Focusing on objects with same number and their relationships):
  [0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [7, 1, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Both outputs are valid depending on the specific goals or intentions guiding the transformations. It's important to note that the transformation rules provided are quite general and may lead to multiple valid solutions for a given input.
