Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to involve grouping adjacent numbers with the same value and preserving their positions. The grid appears to represent a collection of objects, where each object is represented by a number. The objects are arranged in rows and columns.

Output:
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  [2, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5]
  [2, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Case 1:
The transformation rule seems to involve grouping adjacent numbers with the same value and preserving their positions. The grid appears to represent a collection of objects, where each object is represented by a number. The objects are arranged in rows and columns. However, this time, there are some gaps between the objects, which might indicate that some objects have been removed or are occluded by other objects.

Output:
  [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7]
  [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7]
  [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7]

Case 2:
The transformation rule seems to involve grouping adjacent numbers with the same value and preserving their positions. The grid appears to represent a collection of objects, where each object is represented by a number. The objects are arranged in rows and columns. However, this time, there are some gaps between the objects, which might indicate that some objects have been removed or are occluded by other objects.

Output:
  [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7]
  [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7]
  [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7]
