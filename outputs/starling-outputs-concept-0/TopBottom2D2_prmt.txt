Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, it seems like the input grid represents a pattern of 5x5 squares with numbers inside them. The goal is to count the number of occurrences of each number in the grid and rearrange the output grid accordingly.

Here's the breakdown of the counts for each number in the last input grid:

* 0: 18 (background)
* 5: 9 (occurs in a 3x3 square)
* 7: 6 (occurs in a 3x2 rectangle)

Now, we can rearrange the output grid to reflect these counts:

Output:

[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
[0, 5, 0, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0]

This output grid represents the count of each number in the input grid while maintaining the original structure.
