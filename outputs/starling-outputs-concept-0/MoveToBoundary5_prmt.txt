Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid: There are three main objects - a 3x3 object with value 4, a 3x3 object with value 7, and a 2x3 object with value 5. The 3x3 objects have a common side with the background (value 0).

2. Apply transformation rules: Since there are no tasks involving physical contact or counting/sorting, we can simply copy the objects from the input grid to the output grid without any changes.

3. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule is consistent with the previous cases.

Final Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
