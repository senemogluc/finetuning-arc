Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation process for the last input grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships:
   - The first row consists of 5's, which form an object.
   - The second row also consists of 5's, forming another object.
   - The third row has a similar pattern as the first two rows but with an additional 4 in the middle. This forms another object.
   - The fourth and fifth rows have 0's and 5's, forming objects.
   - The sixth row is empty.
   - The seventh to fourteenth rows consist of 4's, forming a large object.
   - The fifteenth row has 0's and 4's, forming an object.
   - The sixteenth row has 0's and 5's, forming an object.
   - The seventeenth row has 0's and 4's, forming an object.
   - The eighteenth row is empty.

2. Apply the transformation rule:
   - The first two rows of 5's are transformed by moving the middle 0 to the right, creating a continuous sequence of 5's.
   - The third row has a similar pattern as the first two rows but with an additional 4 in the middle. This 4 is moved to the left, and the 0 is moved to the right, maintaining the object's shape.
   - The fourth and fifth rows have 0's and 5's, which are transformed by moving the 0's to the left and keeping the 5's in place.
   - The seventh to fourteenth rows of 4's maintain their shape and position since they don't interact with other objects.
   - The fifteenth row has 0's and 4's, which are transformed by moving the 0's to the left and keeping the 4's in place.
   - The sixteenth and seventeenth rows have 0's and 5's, which are transformed by moving the 0's to the left and keeping the 5's in place.
   - The eighteenth row is empty, so no transformation is needed.

3. Output the transformed grid:

Here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4]
