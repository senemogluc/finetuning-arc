Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid:
   - Object A: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object B: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object C: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object D: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. Apply the transformation rule:
   - Object A remains unchanged as it is not adjacent to any other object.
   - Object B and Object C are merged into a single object with values [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This transformation occurs due to the physical contact between Object B and Object C.
   - Object D remains unchanged as it is not adjacent to any other object.

3. Combine the transformed objects into a single grid:
   [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid for the last input is:

  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
