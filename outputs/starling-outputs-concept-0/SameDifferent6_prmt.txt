Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The patterns in the input grid don't seem to follow any clear rules or relationships that can be used to infer a transformation rule. 

However, if we assume that the pattern is formed by connecting adjacent numbers with the same value, we can try to apply a transformation rule as follows:

1. Identify and separate connected components of the same number.
2. For each component, count the number of occurrences of that number.
3. Replace the original component with a single number representing the count from step 2.
4. Fill in the remaining background (0) values to maintain the grid structure.

Applying this rule to the last input grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that this transformation rule is just one possible interpretation of the given input grid. There might be other valid rules or interpretations depending on the context and intended purpose of the task.
