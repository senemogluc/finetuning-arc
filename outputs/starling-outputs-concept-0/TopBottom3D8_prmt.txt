Here's the reasoning for each case:

Case 0: The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. The 3 and 1 are connected horizontally, so they form a single object. The 2 is in the middle of two 1s, so it forms another object with them. The 4 and 3 are connected vertically, so they form a single object.

Case 1: The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. The 3s are connected horizontally, forming a single object. The 4s are also connected horizontally, forming another object. There is no interaction between the two types of objects.

Case 2: The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects. The 7 and 8 are connected vertically, so they form a single object. The 8s are also connected horizontally, forming another object. There is no interaction between the two types of objects.

Case 3: The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. The 5s are connected horizontally and vertically, forming a single object. The 8s are also connected horizontally, forming another object. There is no interaction between the two types of objects.

Case 4: The transformation rule seems to involve recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. The 9s are connected horizontally and vertically, forming a single object. The 3s are also connected horizontally, forming another object. There is no interaction between the two types of objects.

For Case 4, the output grid should be:

  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
