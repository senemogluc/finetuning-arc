Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to involve grouping adjacent numbers with the same value and removing any background (value 0). The output grid should have only the number 3, as it is the most frequent number in the input grid.

Output:
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Case 1:
The transformation rule seems to involve grouping adjacent numbers with the same value and removing any background (value 0). The output grid should have only the number 6, as it is the most frequent number in the input grid.

Output:
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Case 2:
The transformation rule seems to involve grouping adjacent numbers with the same value and removing any background (value 0). The output grid should have only the number 4, as it is the most frequent number in the input grid. However, there are some irregularities in the input grid that make it difficult to apply the transformation rule consistently.

Output:
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

For the last input grid in Case 2, the output grid should have only the number 4, as it is the most frequent number in the input grid:

Output:
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
