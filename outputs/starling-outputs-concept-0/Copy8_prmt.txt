Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify the same numbers that are adjacent to each other in the input grid. In this case, we can see that there are several 8s connected horizontally and vertically. Also, notice that there are some isolated 7s and 0s.
2. Recognize the objects and their relationships. The main object is a group of connected 8s, which form a rectangle shape. There are also isolated 7s and 0s.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic. Count the number of connected 8s in the grid: 12 (4x3). Also, count the number of isolated 7s and 0s: 3 each.
4. Transform the input grid based on the identified relationships and goals. In this case, we can consider the transformation as a rotation of the connected 8s rectangle by 90 degrees clockwise. This will result in a new grid with the same number of objects but different positions.

Here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
