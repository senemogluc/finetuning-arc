Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent numbers:
   - The 2s form a rectangle with dimensions 3x2, centered at (2, 2).
   - The 8 forms a square with dimensions 2x2, centered at (4, 4).

2. Apply transformation rules:
   - The 2s are connected horizontally and vertically, so they can be transformed into a single object by merging them together. This results in a rectangle with dimensions 3x6, centered at (2, 2).
   - The 8 is surrounded by 0s, so it cannot interact with the 2s directly. It remains unchanged.

3. Count and sort objects:
   - There are 4 instances of the number 2 in the input grid. After merging them together, there's only one instance of the merged object.
   - The number 8 is still a single object with no changes.

4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic:
   - Since the merged object has dimensions 3x6, it contains a total of 18 cells (3 * 6 = 18). However, one cell in the center is occupied by the number 8, so the merged object now has 17 cells.

5. Apply elementary geometry and topology concepts:
   - The merged object can be represented as a rectangle with dimensions 3x6, centered at (2, 2). This is the smallest possible representation that includes all the 2s while maintaining their relative positions.

Based on these steps, the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 8]
  [0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 8]
  [0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 8]
  [0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
