Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on adjacent numbers with the same value. In this case, we have three main objects: 
   - Object A: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Object B: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
   - Object C: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

2. Apply the transformation rule that objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. In this case, we can see that Object A and Object B are connected horizontally, so they should be merged into a single object:
   - Merged Object AB: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

3. Apply the transformation rule that recognizes tasks involving physical contact between objects. In this case, we can see that Object AB and Object C are connected vertically, but there is no physical contact or interaction between them. Therefore, they should remain separate:
   - Output Grid: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

So the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
