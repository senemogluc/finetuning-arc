To generate the output grid for the last given input grid, we can follow the transformation rules induced from the previous cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, there are two main objects - the 8s and the background (0). The 8s are connected horizontally and vertically.
2. Pay attention to object transformations and persistence: The 8s persist throughout the grid, and their shape remains the same.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: There is no direct physical contact between the objects in this case.
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for numerical aspects: In this case, there are two 8s connected horizontally and vertically.
5. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: The grid can be seen as a torus or a loop, where the top and bottom edges are connected, as well as the left and right edges.
6. Write down reasoning for each option and pick one: Based on the above analysis, we can connect the two 8s horizontally and vertically to form a single object with the shape of a torus or loop.
7. Check whether the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule seems to work well for the previous cases as well.

Output grid:

  [8, 0, 8]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 8]
