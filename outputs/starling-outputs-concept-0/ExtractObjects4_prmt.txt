Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input. However, we can try to infer a possible output by analyzing the structure and relationships between objects in the input grid. 

Here's one possible approach:

1. Identify the main objects in the grid: In this case, there are two main objects - the horizontal stripes of 8s and the vertical stripes of 0s.

2. Analyze the relationships between these objects: The horizontal stripes of 8s seem to be connected by the vertical stripes of 0s. This suggests that the transformation might involve moving or rotating the horizontal stripes while maintaining their connections with the vertical stripes.

3. Apply the transformation rule: Based on this analysis, we can try to transform the grid by rotating the horizontal stripes of 8s by 90 degrees clockwise and adjusting the positions of the vertical stripes of 0s accordingly. This would result in a new grid with the same number of objects and connections as the original input grid.

Here's one possible output based on this approach:

Output:
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Please note that this is just one possible output based on the analysis and transformation rules provided. There might be other valid outputs as well, depending on the specific intentions or goals guiding the transformations.
