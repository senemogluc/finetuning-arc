Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have a series of horizontal stripes with alternating values (9 and 0) and vertical stripes with alternating values (5 and 9). The horizontal stripes are connected, while the vertical stripes are also connected. There is no interaction between these two types of stripes.

2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Count the number of horizontal stripes and vertical stripes. There are 3 horizontal stripes (9, 0, 9) and 4 vertical stripes (5, 9, 5, 9).

3. Recognize tasks involving numerical aspects: In this case, we have a combination of counting and sorting objects based on their values. The horizontal stripes are sorted by the value 9, while the vertical stripes are sorted by the values 5 and 9.

4. Apply elementary geometry and topology concepts: Since there is no interaction between the horizontal and vertical stripes, we can treat them as separate objects. The horizontal stripes have a length of 3 units (2x9), while the vertical stripes have a length of 4 units (2x5).

5. Transform the input grid based on the identified relationships and goals: Based on the counting and sorting, we can create an output grid with the horizontal stripes aligned horizontally and the vertical stripes aligned vertically. The output grid will have a size of 3x4 units.

6. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs: Since there are no previous input-output pairs provided, we cannot verify if this transformation works for them. However, it does work for the given Case 3 input grid.

Output Grid:

  [9, 0, 9]

  [9, 0, 9]

  [5, 9, 5]
