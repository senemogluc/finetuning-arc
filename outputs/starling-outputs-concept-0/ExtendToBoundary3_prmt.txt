Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The input grid has a repeating pattern of 5s and 0s. The transformation rule should maintain this pattern in the output grid. Since there are no other objects or interactions, the output grid will be the same as the input grid.

Output:
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 1:
The input grid has a repeating pattern of 7s and 0s. The transformation rule should maintain this pattern in the output grid. Since there are no other objects or interactions, the output grid will be the same as the input grid.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
The input grid has a repeating pattern of 3s and 0s. The transformation rule should maintain this pattern in the output grid. Since there are no other objects or interactions, the output grid will be the same as the input grid.

Output:
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 3:
The input grid has a repeating pattern of 1s and 0s. The transformation rule should maintain this pattern in the output grid. Since there are no other objects or interactions, the output grid will be the same as the input grid.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In conclusion, the output grid for the last input is:

  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
