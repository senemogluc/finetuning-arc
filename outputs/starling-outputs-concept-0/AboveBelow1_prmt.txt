Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have two main objects - the 6's and the 0's. The 6's are connected horizontally and vertically, forming a rectangle shape. The 0's are in between the 6's and form a grid-like structure.

2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are 3 rows of 6's and 4 columns of 6's. So, there are a total of 12 6's. The 0's are arranged in a 5x5 grid, with 25 0's.

3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact: In this case, the 6's are connected horizontally and vertically, but there is no significant interaction between them or with the 0's.

4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects: The main task here is to count the number of 6's and 0's in the grid. There are 12 6's and 25 0's.

5. Apply elementary geometry and topology concepts: In this case, there are no significant geometric or topological transformations happening. The main objects (6's and 0's) maintain their shapes and positions.

6. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that the transformation rule is to count the number of 6's and 0's in the input grid and create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the respective counts of 6's and 0's.

7. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule works for all three cases provided.
