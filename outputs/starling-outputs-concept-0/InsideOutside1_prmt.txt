Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The grid seems to have no clear pattern or transformation rule. The objects appear to be randomly distributed, and there are no apparent relationships between them. Therefore, it is difficult to infer any specific transformation rule from this input. However, we can observe that all rows with a value of 1 are removed in the output grid.

Case 1:
In this case, we can see a pattern where objects with value 7 are connected horizontally and vertically. The transformation rule could be to remove all objects with value 6, leaving only the connected objects with value 7. This results in the output grid shown.

Case 2:
Here, we can observe that objects with value 3 are connected horizontally and vertically. The transformation rule could be to remove all objects with value 0, leaving only the connected objects with value 3. This results in the output grid shown.

Case 3:
In this case, we can see a pattern where objects with value 3 are connected horizontally and vertically, while objects with value 5 are isolated. The transformation rule could be to remove all objects with value 0, leaving only the connected objects with value 3 and the isolated objects with value 5. This results in the output grid shown.

For Case 3, the last input is:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5]
  [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

The output grid for this input is:
  [0]
  [0]
  [0]
  [0]
  [0]
  [0]
  [0]
  [0]
  [5]
  [0]
