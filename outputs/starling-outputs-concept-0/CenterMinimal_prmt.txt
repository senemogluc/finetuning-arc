Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same numbers:
   - In the first row, there are two objects with number 0.
   - In the second row, there are three objects with number 0.
   - In the third row, there are four objects with number 0.
   - In the fourth row, there are five objects with number 0.
   - In the fifth row, there are six objects with number 0.

2. Apply transformation rule:
   - Since all objects have the same number (0), no transformation is needed. The output grid will be the same as the input grid.

3. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs:
   - For Cases 0 and 2, the transformation works correctly, as the output grids match the expected results.

Final Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
