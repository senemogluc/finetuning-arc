Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent numbers:
   - The background (0) is a single object surrounding all other objects.
   - Object 1 consists of [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] with 3 instances.
   - Object 5 consists of [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1] with 2 instances.

2. Apply transformation rules:
   - The background (0) remains unchanged.
   - Object 1 can be transformed by removing one instance, resulting in a single object [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1].
   - Object 5 can be transformed by moving the instances horizontally, resulting in a single object [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1].

3. Combine the transformed objects:
   - The background (0) is combined with the remaining instance of object 1 and object 5.
   - Object 1 is combined with the remaining instances of itself and object 5.

4. Final output grid:
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
   [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
   [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1]

So, the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1]
