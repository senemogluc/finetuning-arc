Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, it seems like the input grid represents a pattern with 6s arranged in a specific manner. The transformation rule should focus on preserving these patterns while reducing the grid to its simplest form.

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the main pattern: The main pattern consists of 6s arranged in a square shape, with two additional 6s at the top and bottom edges.
2. Preserve the pattern while reducing the grid: To reduce the grid to its simplest form, we can remove all the 0s and focus on the remaining 6s. This will result in a smaller grid with the same pattern.
3. Apply the transformation rule: Based on the priors, we should recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we have counted the number of 6s in the main pattern (8) and arranged them in a simplified form.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
