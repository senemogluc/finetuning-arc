Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule for this case is to fill in all the empty spaces (0) with the maximum value among adjacent non-empty spaces. 

Here's the reasoning step by step:

1. Identify the empty spaces (0) in the input grid.
2. For each empty space, find the maximum value among its adjacent non-empty spaces.
3. Fill in the empty space with the maximum value found in step 2.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all empty spaces are filled.

Now let's apply this rule to the last input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4]
  [0, 8, 8, 4]
  [0, 8, 8, 4]
  [0, 8, 8, 4]
  [0, 8, 8, 4]

1. Empty spaces are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)
2. For each empty space, find the maximum value among its adjacent non-empty spaces:
   - (0,0): max(0, 0, 0) = 0
   - (0,1): max(0, 4, 8) = 8
   - (0,2): max(0, 4, 8) = 8
   - (0,3): max(0, 4, 8) = 8
   - (1,0): max(0, 0, 4) = 4
   - (1,1): max(0, 4, 8) = 8
   - (1,2): max(0, 4, 8) = 8
   - (1,3): max(0, 4, 8) = 8
   - (2,0): max(0, 0, 8) = 8
   - (2,1): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (2,2): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (2,3): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (3,0): max(0, 0, 8) = 8
   - (3,1): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (3,2): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (3,3): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (4,0): max(0, 0, 8) = 8
   - (4,1): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (4,2): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (4,3): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (5,0): max(0, 0, 8) = 8
   - (5,1): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (5,2): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
   - (5,3): max(0, 8, 8) = 8
3. Fill in the empty spaces with the maximum value found in step 2:

Output:
  [0, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]

So, the output of the last input is:

  [0, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8]
