Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule for this case is to move all objects with a value of 5 one step to the right. Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify objects with the same number adjacent to each other (in this case, only objects with the value 5).
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects (objects with the value 5 are moving horizontally).
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects (no counting needed in this case).
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts as outlined (horizontal movement of objects with the value 5).

Now, let's apply the transformation rule to the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]

The output of the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
