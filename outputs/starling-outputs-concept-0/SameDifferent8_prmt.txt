Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input without more context or specific rules. Here are some possible interpretations of the transformation rule applied to the last input:

1. If we consider that objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object, and the presence of 0 in the grid indicates an empty space, then the output could be:

   Output:
   
      [0]
      [0]
      [0]

2. If we consider that objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object, and the presence of 0 in the grid indicates an empty space, but also take into account the counting or sorting aspect of the numbers, then the output could be:

   Output:
   
      [4, 4, 4, 4]
      [4, 0, 0, 4]
      [4, 0, 0, 4]

3. If we consider that objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object, and the presence of 0 in the grid indicates an empty space, but also take into account the counting or sorting aspect of the numbers, and apply basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects, then the output could be:

   Output:
   
      [4, 4, 4, 4]
      [4, 0, 0, 4]
      [4, 0, 0, 4]

Without more context or specific rules, it's challenging to determine the exact output for the last input.
