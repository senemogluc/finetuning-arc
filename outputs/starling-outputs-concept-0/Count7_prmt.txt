Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The pattern in the input grid does not seem to follow any clear rules or relationships that can be leveraged to create an output grid. 

However, if we consider the presence of the number 6 throughout the grid, one possible approach could be to count the occurrences of the number 6 and place them in a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid. Here's a possible output grid based on this approach:

Output:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]

[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]

This output grid is based on the assumption that the number 6 is significant and should be preserved in the transformation. However, it's important to note that this approach may not be applicable or relevant to other cases or scenarios.
