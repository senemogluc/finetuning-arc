Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning for each case:

Case 2:
1. Identify objects and their relationships: There are three main groups of objects - (8, 8), (7, 7), and (3, 3). The (1, 1) and (5, 5) pairs are also related but not part of the main groups.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Count the number of occurrences for each object in the grid.
3. Transform the grid based on the identified relationships and counts:
   - The (8, 8) group has 4 occurrences, so place a 4 at position (0, 0).
   - The (7, 7) group has 2 occurrences, so place a 2 at position (3, 3).
   - The (3, 3) group has 2 occurrences, so place a 2 at position (6, 6).
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: Since the grid is symmetric, we can mirror the output grid to maintain symmetry.
5. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule seems to work for all cases provided.

Based on this reasoning, the output grid for the last input is:
  [4, 2, 2]
