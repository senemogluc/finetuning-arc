Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same numbers:
   - Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (background)
   - Object 2: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0] (with 3s)
   - Object 3: [3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0] (with 3s)
   - Object 4: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0] (with 3s)

2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic:
   - Count the number of objects with 3s: 3
   - Sum of 3s in each object: 6, 9, and 12

3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects:
   - Object 2 and Object 3 are touching horizontally, so they will merge into a single object with 6 3s.
   - Object 3 and Object 4 are also touching horizontally, so they will merge into a single object with 9 3s.

4. Apply transformation rules:
   - Merge Object 2 and Object 3 to form a new object: [3, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0]
   - Merge Object 3 and Object 4 to form a new object: [3, 9, 0, 3, 0, 0]

5. Final output grid:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
   [3, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]
   [3, 9, 0, 0, 3, 0]
   [3, 9, 9, 0, 3, 0]
