Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input. The transformation rules involve recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects, counting or sorting objects, and persistence of objects despite noise or occlusion. However, the provided input does not clearly show any patterns that can be used to apply these rules consistently.

To provide an output, I will make some assumptions about the relationships between the numbers in the grid:

1. The 7s seem to be part of a larger pattern, possibly representing objects.
2. The 0s might represent background or empty spaces between the objects.
3. The 2s and 4s could be part of the same object as the 7s, but it's not clear from the input alone.

Based on these assumptions, I will try to create an output grid that follows the transformation rules:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7]
  [0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]
  [7, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 7, 4, 4, 4, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0]
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that this output is based on assumptions and might not be the correct one. The actual transformation rule for this case is unclear from the provided input alone.
