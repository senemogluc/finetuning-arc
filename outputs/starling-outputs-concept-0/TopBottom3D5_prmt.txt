Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on adjacent numbers with the same value. In this case, we have several objects formed by 8s, 6s, and 3s.
2. Apply the transformation rule that objects persist despite noise or occlusion. This means that the 8s, 6s, and 3s will remain in their respective positions even if they are surrounded by other numbers.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we have three types of objects: 8s, 6s, and 3s. Count the number of each object in the input grid:
   - 8s: 12 (4x3)
   - 6s: 9 (3x3)
   - 3s: 6 (2x3)
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic to determine the output grid. Since there are 12 8s, we can place them in a 4x3 grid. Similarly, place the 9 6s in a 3x3 grid and the 6 3s in a 2x3 grid.
5. The final output grid is:

   [8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8]

This transformation rule works for all the previous input-output pairs as well.
