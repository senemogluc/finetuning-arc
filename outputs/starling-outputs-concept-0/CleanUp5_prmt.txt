Here's my reasoning for each option and then I will pick one:

1. The first case seems to have a pattern where all the 4's are connected horizontally and vertically, forming a rectangle shape. The 0's seem to be the background color. The transformation rule could be to keep the connected 4's as they are but remove any isolated 4's or other numbers. However, this pattern doesn't seem to apply to the second case.

2. In the second case, there are two main objects: a rectangle of 0's and a rectangle of 6's. The 2's and 0's seem to be part of the 6's object, as they are connected to it. The transformation rule could be to keep the connected 6's and 2's as they are but remove any isolated 6's or other numbers. This pattern also applies to the first case, where the 4's and 0's form a similar rectangle shape.

3. In the third case, there are two main objects: a rectangle of 0's and a rectangle of 2's. The 4's seem to be part of the 2's object, as they are connected to it. However, this pattern doesn't seem to apply to the other cases.

Based on the analysis above, I believe the transformation rule is to keep the connected 6's and 2's as they are but remove any isolated 6's or other numbers. This rule applies to all three cases.

Now, let's generate the output grid for the last input:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Output:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
