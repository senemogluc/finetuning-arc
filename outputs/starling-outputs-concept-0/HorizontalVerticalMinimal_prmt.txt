Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output:

1. Identify objects in the input grid: There are four main objects in the input grid - a 3x3 square object with value 4 at the center, and three 2x2 square objects with value 4 at the center. The background is represented by 0 values.

2. Apply transformation rules: Since there are no interactions or transformations between the objects, we can simply remove the noise (0 values) around the main objects to obtain a clearer representation of them.

3. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule is consistent with the previous cases, as it removes noise while preserving the main objects.

4. Output grid: Based on the reasoning above, the output grid for the last input should be:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
