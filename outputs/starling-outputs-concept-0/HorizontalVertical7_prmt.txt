Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule seems to be about counting and sorting objects. The numbers are arranged in a grid, with the same number appearing adjacent to each other forming an object. The goal is to count and sort these objects. In this case, we can see that there are two objects with the number 8, and one object with the number 2. By counting and sorting these objects, we get the output grid.

Case 1:
The transformation rule seems to be about counting and sorting objects as well. The numbers are arranged in a grid, with the same number appearing adjacent to each other forming an object. The goal is to count and sort these objects. In this case, we can see that there are two objects with the number 4, and one object with the number 2. By counting and sorting these objects, we get the output grid.

Case 2:
The transformation rule seems to be about counting and sorting objects as well. The numbers are arranged in a grid, with the same number appearing adjacent to each other forming an object. The goal is to count and sort these objects. In this case, we can see that there are two objects with the number 3, one object with the number 2, and one object with the number 0. By counting and sorting these objects, we get the output grid.

Case 3:
The transformation rule seems to be about counting and sorting objects as well. The numbers are arranged in a grid, with the same number appearing adjacent to each other forming an object. The goal is to count and sort these objects. In this case, we can see that there are two objects with the number 7, and one object with the number 5. By counting and sorting these objects, we get the output grid.

For the last input in Case 3:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
