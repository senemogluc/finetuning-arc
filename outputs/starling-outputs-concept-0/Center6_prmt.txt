Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have a grid with two types of objects - those with value 8 and those with value 0. The 8-valued objects are arranged in a square pattern, while the 0-valued objects form a background around them. There is also an object with value 3 at the bottom right corner.
2. Analyze transformations: The main transformation here is the arrangement of the 8-valued objects forming a square shape. The 0-valued objects remain unchanged, and the 3-valued object is left untouched.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are 9 8-valued objects in the grid, forming a 3x3 square.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: The 8-valued objects form a square shape, which is a simple geometric figure with four right angles and four equal sides.
5. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule seems to work consistently across all cases provided.

Based on this reasoning, the output of the last input (Case 3) should be:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
