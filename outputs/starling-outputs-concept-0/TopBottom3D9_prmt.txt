Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have a background (0) and several groups of objects with the same number (1, 5). The objects are connected horizontally and vertically.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are 6 groups of 1s and 2 groups of 5s in the input grid.
3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: In this case, there is no direct physical contact between objects.
4. Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects: We have 6 groups of 1s and 2 groups of 5s.
5. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects: The size of the groups is different (6 for 1s and 2 for 5s).
6. Apply elementary geometry and topology concepts: In this case, we can consider the grid as a collection of connected components with the same number.
7. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: Based on the analysis above, we have 6 groups of 1s and 2 groups of 5s in the input grid. The transformation rule is to keep the objects connected horizontally and vertically.
8. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule works for all previous cases as well.
9. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid: In this case, the output grid has the same size as the input grid.
