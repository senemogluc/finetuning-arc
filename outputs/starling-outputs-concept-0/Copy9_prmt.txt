Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
The transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can see that there are two groups of objects with the same number (1) adjacent to each other. The first group is in the middle row and the second group is at the bottom left corner. We can rearrange these groups by moving the 0s around them without changing their relative positions within the groups.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Case 1:
In this case, we can see that there are two groups of objects with the same number adjacent to each other. The first group is in the middle row and the second group is at the bottom left corner. We can rearrange these groups by moving the 0s around them without changing their relative positions within the groups.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3]
  [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 2:
In this case, we can see that there are two groups of objects with the same number adjacent to each other. The first group is in the middle row and the second group is at the bottom left corner. We can rearrange these groups by moving the 0s around them without changing their relative positions within the groups.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Case 3:
In this case, we can see that there are two groups of objects with the same number adjacent to each other. The first group is in the middle row and the second group is at the bottom left corner. We can rearrange these groups by moving the 0s around them without changing their relative positions within the groups.

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
