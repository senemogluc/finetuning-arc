Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects by same-colored adjacent cells. In this case, we have several objects with colors 8, 7, and 4.
2. Apply the transformation rule that objects persist despite noise or occlusion. This means that even if there are different colored cells in between, the main object will still be considered as a single entity.
3. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects. In this case, we have 8s and 7s, but no specific counting task is given. However, we can notice that the 4s are part of the larger 8 objects.
4. Apply basic arithmetic if needed. No arithmetic operations are required in this case.
5. Recognize elementary geometry and topology concepts. In this case, we have rectangular shapes with varying sizes.
6. Check whether the transformation rule works on previous input-output pairs. It does, as the objects persist through the transformations.
7. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid. In this case, it's the same size as the input grid.

Now, let's create the output grid:

Output:
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 4, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7]
