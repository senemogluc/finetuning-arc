Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid: There are two main objects - a large square object with value 3, and a small square object with value 0. The large square object is formed by the values 3, and the small square object is formed by the values 0.
2. Apply transformation rules: Since there are no tasks involving physical contact, counting, or sorting objects, we can simply copy the input grid as the output grid.
3. Check if the transformation works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation works for both Case 0 and Case 1, as the output grids match the provided output grids.

Final Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
