I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here's the correct output for the last input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]
  [3, 3, 3]

The transformation rule is based on recognizing the same numbers that are adjacent to each other as part of the same object. Objects are assumed to persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. The output grid has the same structure as the input grid, with no significant transformations, as there are no physical interactions or counting/sorting tasks involved in this case.
