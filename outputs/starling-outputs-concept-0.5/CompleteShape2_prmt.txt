Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation process for the given input grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships:
   - There are two main objects in the grid: 2 and 8. They are adjacent to each other at several points, and they persist throughout the grid.
   - The object with value 2 is connected horizontally, while the object with value 8 is connected both horizontally and vertically.

2. Apply the transformation rule:
   - Since the objects with values 2 and 8 are in contact and have a similar shape (both rectangular), we can assume that they will merge together during the transformation process.
   - To achieve this, we need to fill the spaces between the 2s and the surrounding 8s with the value 8. This way, the entire object will be filled with the same value.

3. Perform the transformation:
   - Replace all instances of 2 with 8 in the grid:
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

4. Output grid:
   The output grid is the transformed grid after applying the transformation rule:

     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

So, the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
