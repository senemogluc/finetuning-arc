Case 3:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the previous cases:

Case 0: The grid has a single object with the number 1. The transformation reduces the grid to only the objects with the number 1.
Case 1: The grid has a single object with the number 2, which is repeated multiple times. The transformation reduces the grid to only the objects with the number 2.
Case 2: The grid has a single object with the number 4, which is repeated multiple times. The transformation reduces the grid to only the objects with the number 4.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same-number cells.
2. Reduce the grid to only the objects with the specified number.

Now let's apply this rule to the last input:

Input:
  [6, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 0]
  [6, 6, 6]

Here, we have a single object with the number 6. Following the transformation rule, we reduce the grid to only the objects with the number 6:

Output:
  [6, 6, 6]

This output is consistent with the previous input-output pairs and the inferred transformation rule.
