Given the input grid for Case 2, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule based on the provided information. The grid seems to consist of isolated groups of similar numbers without any obvious relationships or interactions between them. Therefore, it's challenging to infer a meaningful transformation rule from this input alone.

However, if we consider the numerical aspect and apply basic arithmetic, we can try to create an output grid with the sum of each row equal to zero:

Output:
  [2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2]
  [-4, 0, 4, 0, -4, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, -4, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, -4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid is one possible transformation that could be applied to the input grid, but it's important to note that this solution is arbitrary and not necessarily derived from a specific transformation rule.
