To generate the output grid for the last given input grid, we can follow the transformation rules from the previous cases. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, the objects are formed by the same numbers adjacent to each other. We have four main objects:
   - Object 1: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2]
   - Object 2: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]
   - Object 3: [2, 0, 2, 2, 2] (formed by adjacent 2s)
   - Object 4: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: We can see that each object has a specific count of the number it represents. For example, Object 1 has three 2s.

3. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: In this case, there is no apparent physical contact between the objects.

4. Transformations and persistence: We can observe that each object maintains its shape throughout the grid. However, we need to adjust their positions to ensure the output grid is as compact as possible.

5. Reasoning for the output grid: Based on the analysis above, we can place the objects in a more compact manner while maintaining their integrity and relationships. Here's one way to do this:

   Output:
     [0, 2, 2, 0, 2]
     [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]
     [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]
     [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

In this output grid, we have placed the objects as compactly as possible while maintaining their integrity and relationships. The transformation rule has been applied to create a more organized representation of the input grid.
