Based on the given prior that objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects, and recognizing tasks involving counting or sorting objects, we can infer that the output grid will have a similar structure as the input grid with the object 8 being replaced by 0 in some positions. Here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
