Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific output for the last input without more context or information about the relationship between the objects in the grid. However, considering the presence of 1's and the fact that they are adjacent to each other, we can infer that these 1's might be part of an object. 

Here's one possible output for the last input:

Output:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that this output is just one possibility among many others, and it's essential to have more context or information about the objects in the grid to determine a specific output.
