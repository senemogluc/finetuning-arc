Based on the transformation rules provided and the previous cases, I will generate the output grid for the last given input grid.

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6]
  [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6]
  [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid follows the transformation rules provided and is consistent with the previous cases.
