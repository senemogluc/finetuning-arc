Case 3:

To find the transformation rule for this case, we can observe that there are groups of objects with similar values that are adjacent to each other. The objects are part of the same group and maintain their shape throughout the transformations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning behind the output grid:

1. Identify and separate the groups of adjacent objects with the same value in the input grid:
   - Group 1 (3, 3): [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Group 2 (3, 0): [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Group 3 (3, 3): [3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Group 4 (0, 0): [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Group 5 (0, 0): [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - Group 6 (3, 3): [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
   - Group 7 (3, 3): [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4]
   - Group 8 (0, 4): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4]
   - Group 9 (4, 4): [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4]
   - Group 10 (4, 4): [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

2. Recognize that groups with the same value maintain their shape throughout the transformations:
   - Groups 1 and 4 have the shape of a horizontal line.
   - Group 2 has the shape of a vertical line.
   - Groups 3, 5, and 6 have the shape of a horizontal line with an additional column in the middle.
   - Group 7 has the same shape as group 6 but shifted one position to the right.
   - Groups 8 and 9 have the shape of a vertical line.
   - Group 10 has the same shape as group 9 but shifted one position to the right.

3. Transform each group by applying the transformation rule from the previous input-output pairs:
   - Groups 1, 2, and 4 maintain their horizontal shape.
   - Groups 3, 5, and 6 maintain their horizontal shape with an additional column in the middle.
   - Group 7 maintains its shifted horizontal shape.
   - Groups 8 and 9 maintain their vertical shape.
   - Group 10 maintains its shifted vertical shape.

4. Combine all the transformed groups to form the output grid:

Output:
  [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This is the output grid for the last input.
