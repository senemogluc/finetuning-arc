Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify the objects and their relationships in the grid: In this case, there are numbers from 0 to 8 that represent different colors or values. The numbers adjacent to each other have the same color. The number 6 is surrounded by 8s, which implies it might be part of a separate object.

2. Transform the grid based on the identified relationships: We can see a pattern where the 0s are in the corners and edges of the grid, while the numbers from 1 to 8 form a square in the center. The number 6 is surrounded by 8s, so it could be part of that central square or an isolated object.

3. Apply the transformation rule: Since the central square has a consistent pattern with the surrounding 8s, we can consider it as one object. We can remove the 0s in the corners and edges to focus on this central object. The transformed grid will be:

  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

So, the output of the last input is:

  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  [8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
