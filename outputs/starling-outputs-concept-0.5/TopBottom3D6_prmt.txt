Based on the transformation rules provided and the previous cases, we can infer that the goal here is to identify and group objects with the same number. Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Identify and group adjacent objects with the same number:
   - In the input grid, there are three main groups of objects: 0, 4, and 8.
   - The 0 group is in the top-left corner and doesn't have any connections to other groups. We can safely remove it.
   - The 4 group is connected to the 8 group at one point. Since there are no other connections between these two groups, we can consider them as separate objects. However, since the 4 group has only one object (top-left corner), we can merge it with the 8 group.
   - The 8 group has three objects connected to each other and forms a single object.

2. Apply counting or sorting tasks if necessary:
   - In this case, there are no specific counting or sorting tasks involved.

3. Recognize physical contact between objects:
   - There is no physical contact between the 4 and 8 groups in the input grid. They are separate objects.

4. Transform the grid based on the identified relationships, persistence, and goals:
   - Remove the 0 group from the output grid.
   - Merge the 4 group with the 8 group.

Based on these steps, the output grid for the last input is:

  [8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8]
