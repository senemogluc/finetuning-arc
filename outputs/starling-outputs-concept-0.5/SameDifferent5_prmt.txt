Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's not possible to determine a unique output for the last input without more context or information about the task. The transformation rule induced from the previous cases doesn't provide enough guidance to infer the exact output grid for this specific input.

To provide an output, we need more context or additional priors related to the specific task at hand.
