Based on the given priors and previous transformations, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input without more context or specific rules. Here are some possible outputs based on different interpretations:

Option 1:
Output:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Option 2:
Output:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Both options are valid based on the given priors and previous transformations. However, without more context or specific rules, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input.
