Case 2:

To determine the transformation rule for this case, we can observe that the grid consists of two distinct objects with color 7 and one object with color 8. The objects with color 7 are connected horizontally and vertically, while the object with color 8 is also connected to both of them. However, no other connections between the objects are observed.

The transformation rule for this case can be as follows:

1. Identify and separate the three distinct objects based on their colors (7 and 8).
2. Preserve the shape and size of each object during the transformation.
3. Ensure that the physical contact between the objects is maintained in the transformed grid.
4. Apply basic arithmetic to count the number of objects and their occurrences.

Based on this rule, we can transform the input grid into the output grid:

Output:
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

The output of the last input is:
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
