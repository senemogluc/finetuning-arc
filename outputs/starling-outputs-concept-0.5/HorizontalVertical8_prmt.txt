Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify the same-colored adjacent objects in the input grid. In this case, we have groups of 3s, 6s, and 8s.
2. Transform the grid by moving these groups to their respective locations in the output grid. For example, move the group of 3s from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
3. Repeat step 1 for each input grid, applying the same logic to identify and transform objects.
4. Combine all the transformed grids to create the final output grid.

Here's the final output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
