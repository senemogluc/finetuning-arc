Based on the given prior, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing and leveraging elementary geometry and topology concepts. The main idea here is to identify objects with a specific shape (in this case, rectangles) and their properties (such as size or color).

Here's the reasoning for the transformation:

1. Identify the rectangles in the grid. Rectangles are formed by 4 connected cells of the same color (excluding the background color). In this input grid, we can find the following rectangles:
   - Top-left rectangle with color 7 and size 3x6
   - Top-right rectangle with color 5 and size 3x2
   - Bottom-left rectangle with color 7 and size 3x6
   - Bottom-right rectangle with color 0 (background)

2. Determine the properties of these rectangles:
   - The top-left and bottom-left rectangles have the same size and color, so they can be considered as a single object.
   - The top-right rectangle has a smaller size than the other two rectangles but is also connected to them in terms of their positions on the grid.
   - The bottom-right rectangle is an empty rectangle with no objects inside it. It doesn't affect the transformation since it doesn't have any color.

3. Apply the transformation rule:
   - Move the top-left and bottom-left rectangles to the right, occupying the position of the top-right rectangle, while keeping their original size and color. This creates a continuous row of rectangles with the same size and color.
   - The top-right rectangle is removed from the grid since it doesn't have any objects inside it.

4. Generate the output grid based on the transformed positions of the rectangles:
