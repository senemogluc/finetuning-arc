To find the transformation rule, we can analyze the given cases and their corresponding outputs. Here are some observations from the provided cases:

1. The background (0) is not part of any object and remains unchanged.
2. Objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object. This means that the grid should be traversed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to identify objects.
3. Objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects. In some cases, objects may transform (e.g., rotation, translation) but still maintain their identity.
4. Tasks involving counting or sorting objects require comparison of numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.
5. The transformation rule should be applicable to the entire sequence of input-output pairs.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:

1. Identify connected components of the same number (objects).
2. For each object, check if it has an adjacent object with the same number and is not separated by a different number. If true, merge the objects horizontally or vertically.
3. If an object has an adjacent object that is part of another object, move the entire object to the adjacent object's position.
4. Remove any remaining isolated objects (objects without connections).
5. Apply the transformation rule iteratively until no more changes can be made.

Now let's apply this rule to the last input grid:

Input:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1]

Applying the transformation rule:

1. Identify connected components of the same number (objects).
2. For each object, check if it has an adjacent object with the same number and is not separated by a different number. If true, merge the objects horizontally or vertically.
3. If an object has an adjacent object that is part of another object, move the entire object to the adjacent object's position.
4. Remove any remaining isolated objects (objects without connections).
5. Apply the transformation rule iteratively until no more changes can be made.

After applying the transformation rule:

Output:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1]

This output grid is consistent with the transformation rule and can be considered the correct output for the last input grid.
