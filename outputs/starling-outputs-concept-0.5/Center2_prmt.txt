Based on the provided transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a clear pattern or rule for this specific set of inputs. The transformation rules seem to be focused on identifying objects based on adjacent values, persistence, counting, and geometry/topology concepts. However, the given input-output pairs don't provide enough information to derive a consistent transformation rule that can be applied across all cases.

In order to generate an output grid for the last given input (Case 3: [7, 5, 4]), we would need more context or a clearer set of rules to follow. As it stands, there is not enough information provided to create a valid output grid based on the existing cases and transformation rules.
