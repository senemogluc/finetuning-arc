To determine the transformation rule and generate the output for the last input, let's analyze the given inputs and outputs:

1. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   Output:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   Output:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

3. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   Output:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

4. Input:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   Output:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

From the analysis above, it's clear that the transformation rule is to keep the input grid unchanged. Thus, the output for the last input (Case 4) should be:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
