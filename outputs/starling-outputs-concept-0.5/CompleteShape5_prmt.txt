Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In the input grid, we can identify two main objects - a 2x3 rectangle of '3's (top-left) and a 2x2 rectangle of '4's (bottom-right). The remaining '0' values are background. There is no clear interaction or transformation between these two objects.
2. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: There are no numerical aspects in this grid that require counting or sorting.
3. Recognize elementary geometry and topology concepts: The main objects are rectangular, but their shapes don't change during the transformation.
4. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: Since there is no clear interaction or transformation between the two main objects, we can consider them as separate entities that persist in the output grid without any transformation. 
5. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule holds true for all three cases provided.

Final Output Grid:
[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]
[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]

The output of the last input is:
[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]
[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
