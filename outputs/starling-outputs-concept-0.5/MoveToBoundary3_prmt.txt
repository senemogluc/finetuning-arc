After analyzing the given cases and priors, it's not possible to determine a specific transformation rule that applies consistently across all cases. The patterns in the input grids do not seem to follow any consistent rules or principles, making it difficult to infer a transformation rule. 

As a result, I cannot provide an output grid for the last input since there is no clear pattern or rule to apply.
