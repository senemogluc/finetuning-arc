In order to find the output for the last input, we can apply the transformation rules based on the previous cases. The transformation rule seems to involve grouping adjacent same-colored squares and then moving them horizontally or vertically. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation:

1. Group adjacent same-colored squares:
   - Top row: [0, 0, 0, 1]
   - Second row: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - Third row: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
   - Fourth row: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
   - Fifth row: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
   - Sixth row: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - Seventh row: [0, 0, 0, 1]

2. Move the groups horizontally or vertically (assuming a rightward movement):
   - Top row: [0, 0, 0, 1] -> [0, 0, 0, 1]
   - Second row: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] -> [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - Third row: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] -> [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
   - Fourth row: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] -> [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
   - Fifth row: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] -> [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
   - Sixth row: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] -> [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - Seventh row: [0, 0, 0, 1] -> [0, 0, 0, 1]

3. Flatten the output into a single row:
   Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

This is the output for the last input.
