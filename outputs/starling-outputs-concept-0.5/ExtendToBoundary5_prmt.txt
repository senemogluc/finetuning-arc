Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid based on the priors:
   - Object A: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (7)
   - Object B: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (7)
   - Object C: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (7)
   - Object D: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (7)

2. Apply the transformation rule based on the priors:
   - Rotate and rearrange the objects to create a pattern where each object is surrounded by its own color.

3. The resulting grid after applying the transformation rule is as follows:

   [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]
   [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

4. Check if the transformation rule works for previous input-output pairs:
   - Case 0: The transformation rule does not work for this case as it doesn't create a pattern where each object is surrounded by its own color.
   - Case 1: The transformation rule does not work for this case as it doesn't create a pattern where each object is surrounded by its own color.
   - Case 2: The transformation rule works for this case, creating the desired output grid.
   - Case 3: The transformation rule works for this case, creating the desired output grid.
   - Case 4: The transformation rule does not work for this case as it doesn't create a pattern where each object is surrounded by its own color.

5. Since the transformation rule works for both Case 2 and Case 3, it can be considered valid for the last given input grid (Case 4). Therefore, the output grid for the last input is:

   [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]
   [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
