Based on the given input and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies consistently across all cases. However, I can provide an output grid for the last input based on some assumptions:

Case 3 Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that this output is based on assumptions and may not be the correct transformation rule for all cases.
