Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves identifying and separating objects based on their values and adjacency. In this case, the only objects are those with a value greater than 0.

Here's the reasoning for each step of the transformation:

1. Identify adjacent objects with the same value (2) and group them together. This forms two separate groups: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
2. Separate objects with different values (8). In this case, there's only one object with value 8, which forms a separate group: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8].
3. Place the separated groups in their original positions based on their previous locations in the input grid.

Based on this reasoning, the output grid for the last given input is as follows:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
