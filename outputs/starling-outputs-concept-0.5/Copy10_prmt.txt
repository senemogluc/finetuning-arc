Based on the given priors and the previous input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation rule involves counting and sorting objects, recognizing tasks involving numerical aspects, and comparing numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects. 

Here's a possible output for the last input:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this output, the number 6 is replaced with 7, and the number 7 is replaced with a larger version of itself (e.g., 8 or 9). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.
