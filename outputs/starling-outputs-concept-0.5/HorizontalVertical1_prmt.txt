Here's the reasoning for this transformation:

1. The input grid has a structure with a central 4x4 block surrounded by a border of 5s. This central block is a pattern that repeats horizontally and vertically.
2. The output grid has a similar structure, but with a small shift in the position of the central block and the border.
3. The transformation rule maintains the same structure, but translates it to the left by one column and down by one row. This is consistent with the observed pattern in the input grid.
