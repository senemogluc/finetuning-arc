Based on the transformation rules provided and the patterns observed in previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves identifying objects with the same number adjacent to each other and grouping them together. In this case, the pattern appears to be a 2x3 grid of the same number (in this case, 8).

Here's the reasoning for the output grid:

1. The input grid has a 2x3 grid of 8s in the center. We can consider these as a single object since they are adjacent to each other and have the same value.
2. The outer rows consist of only 0s, which can be considered as separate objects.
3. The transformation rule does not involve any specific counting or sorting tasks, so we don't need to apply arithmetic operations or consider elementary geometry or topology concepts explicitly.
4. We can remove the outer rows since they do not contribute to forming a meaningful object.

Based on this reasoning, the output grid for the last input is:

  [0, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8]
