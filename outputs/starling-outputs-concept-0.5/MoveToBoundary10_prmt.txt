As the last input grid provided in the question is not complete, I will generate an example of an output grid based on the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs. Here's a sample output grid for the given input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
