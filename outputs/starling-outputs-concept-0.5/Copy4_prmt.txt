Here's my reasoning for each option and then I will pick one:

- In Case 0, we can see that the objects are arranged in a grid pattern with the same numbers adjacent to each other. The transformation rule should maintain this pattern as much as possible. 
- In Case 1, there are some objects with the same number but not necessarily adjacent. However, they seem to be grouped together and share the same color (6 or 3). We can apply a transformation that groups these objects together. 
- In Case 2, we have a similar situation as in Case 1, where objects with the same number are grouped together but not necessarily adjacent. Here, we can also apply a transformation that groups these objects together.

Considering the three cases, I will choose the transformation rule based on Case 1 since it has more objects and seems to follow a clear pattern. The output for the last input in Case 1 is:

  [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [0, 3, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [0, 3, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
