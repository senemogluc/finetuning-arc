Here's a breakdown of my reasoning for each case:

Case 0: The grid has a single object with values 2 and 1. Since there are no other objects or interactions, the output should be an empty grid.

Output:
[0]
[0]
[0]

Case 1: There are several objects in this grid, but they don't interact with each other. The main object is a rectangle with values 7 and 6, surrounded by background (value 0). The output should be an empty grid as there are no interactions or transformations.

Output:
[0]
[0]

Case 2: There are two objects in this grid - a rectangle with value 3 and another one with value 9. They don't interact with each other, so the output should be an empty grid.

Output:
[0]
[0]
[0]

Case 3: This grid has a single object with values 3 and 5, arranged in a rectangular shape. There are no interactions or transformations, so the output should be an empty grid.

Output:
[0]
[0]
[0]

The last input of Case 3 is as follows:

Input:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

The output for this input is the same as in Case 3:

Output:
[0]
[0]
[0]
