Here are the steps to derive the transformation rule and find the output grid for the last input:

1. Analyze the input patterns: In each case, we can observe that the numbers in the same row or column form a "V" shape pattern. The numbers in the diagonal also form a "V" shape pattern. 

2. Interpret the priors: Since the numbers are part of objects and their persistence is assumed despite noise or occlusion by other objects, we can infer that these V-shaped patterns represent the objects on the grid. The transformation rule should account for the movement and interaction between these objects.

3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic: Counting the number of occurrences of each number in a row or column helps us understand the distribution of objects in the grid. For example, in Case 0, we can see that there are 4 occurrences of 1's in each row and column.

4. Recognize geometry and topology concepts: The V-shaped patterns indicate that the objects have some symmetry or regularity to them. This suggests that the transformation rule should take into account these geometric properties.

5. Write down reasoning for each option and pick one: Based on our analysis, we can infer that the transformation rule should involve rotating the grid by 45 degrees counterclockwise and then translating the objects horizontally or vertically based on their positions in the original grid. This rotation and translation would result in a new grid where the objects align better with each other, and their interactions become more apparent.

6. Check whether the transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: After applying the transformation rule to the last input (Case 3), we get the following output grid:

Output:
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Comparing the output grid with the previous input-output pairs, we can see that this transformation rule works consistently. Therefore, the output for the last input (Case 3) is:

[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
