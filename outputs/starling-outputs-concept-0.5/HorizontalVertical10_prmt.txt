To generate the Output grid that corresponds to the last given Input grid using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify and group objects based on their adjacent same numbers. In this case, we have 3, 4, 5, and 1 as the main objects.
2. Count the number of occurrences for each object. Here are the counts:
   - 3: 8 times
   - 4: 6 times
   - 5: 6 times
   - 1: 6 times
3. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid and fill it with zeros.
4. For each object, place the object in the output grid at a random position while ensuring that it doesn't overlap with other objects of the same type. In this case, we can start from the top-left corner and move downwards and leftwards.
5. Fill any remaining empty spaces in the output grid with zeros.

Here is the generated Output grid:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This is the Output grid that corresponds to the last given Input grid using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs.
