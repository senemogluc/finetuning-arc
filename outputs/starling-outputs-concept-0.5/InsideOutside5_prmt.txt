Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the transformation rule involves recognizing and merging objects with the same color (value) and eliminating empty spaces (0). Here's a step-by-step explanation of the transformation for the last input:

1. Merge all objects with the same color value (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) and eliminate empty spaces (0).
2. For each row, if there are no objects left in a row, remove that row from the output grid.

Following these steps, we get the following output grid:

Output:
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]
  [1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6]
  [1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6]
  [1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6]
  [1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]
  [1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]
  [1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]
  [1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
