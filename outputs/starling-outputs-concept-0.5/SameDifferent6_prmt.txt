Based on the given cases and the priors provided, it's not possible to determine a unique output for the last input. The transformation rule is not explicitly defined for this specific scenario, and there are multiple valid interpretations depending on the context or additional information that might be available. 

Here are two potential outputs based on different interpretations:

Output 1:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output 2:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Both outputs are valid depending on the context or additional information that might be available.
