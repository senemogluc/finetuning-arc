To solve this problem, let's analyze the given input and apply the transformation rules.

Input:
  [6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]
  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]

First, we can identify objects by looking at adjacent numbers that are the same. We have four main objects here:

1. The first row with 6's and 8's. They form a rectangle with dimensions 4x2.
2. The second row with 6's and 8's. They also form a rectangle with dimensions 4x2.
3. The third row with 6's and 8's. Again, they form a rectangle with dimensions 4x2.
4. The fourth row with 6's and 8's. This one also forms a rectangle with dimensions 4x2.
5. The last two rows with 9's and 3's. They form a rectangle with dimensions 2x3.

Now, let's apply the transformation rules:

1. Persist objects despite noise or occlusion: We already identified the main objects in the grid.
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects: There is no explicit physical contact between objects in this case.
3. Counting and sorting objects: We have four rectangles with dimensions 4x2, and one rectangle with dimensions 2x3.

Now, let's apply the transformation rules to create the output grid:

1. Merge all the 6's in each row into a single object: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8] for the first four rows, and [0, 3, 3, 3] for the fifth row.
2. Merge all the 8's in each row into a single object: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4] for the first four rows, and [0, 6, 6, 6] for the fifth row.
3. For the rectangles with dimensions 4x2, we can create one large rectangle with dimensions 8x2 by merging the two adjacent rectangles: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], and so on.
4. For the rectangle with dimensions 2x3, we can create one large rectangle with dimensions 2x6 by merging the two adjacent rectangles: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Output grid:
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

So, the output grid for the last input is:
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
