Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each case:

Case 0:
We can see that there are several instances of the number 3 appearing in groups. The transformation rule involves recognizing these groups and isolating them. In this case, the number 3 appears in a group of 4 in the first row, and another group of 4 in the last row. We can remove the background (0) to obtain the desired output:

Output:
  [3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Case 1:
Similar to Case 0, the number 6 appears in a group of 5 in the first and last rows. We can remove the background (0) to obtain the desired output:

Output:
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Case 2:
In this case, the number 4 appears in a group of 5 in the first and last rows, while the number 7 appears in a group of 3 in the second row. We can remove the background (0) to obtain the desired output:

Output:
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
