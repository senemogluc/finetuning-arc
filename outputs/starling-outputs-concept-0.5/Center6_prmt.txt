Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to generate the output grid for the last input.

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's how the transformation rule is applied:

1. The input grid has 3x3 blocks of objects (8 and 0). We can treat each block as a single object. By doing this, we transform the grid into a 3x3 grid with the following objects: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], and [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8].
2. The transformation rule states that objects with the same value adjacent to each other are part of the same object. In this case, all objects in the grid have a value of 8 or 0, so they are already part of the same objects.
3. The transformation rule also mentions counting or sorting objects. However, since all objects have the same value (8), there is no need to perform any counting or sorting operations.
4. Finally, the output grid should be the same size as the input grid or smaller. In this case, the input and output grids are of the same size (3x3).

Based on these steps, the output grid is:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
