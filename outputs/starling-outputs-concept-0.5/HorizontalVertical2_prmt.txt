In order to generate the output grid for the last given input grid using the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs, we need to consider the priors and follow the reasoning process. However, it's essential to note that without a clear understanding of the rules or a specific example to follow, it's challenging to provide an accurate output grid. 

Here are some general steps to approach this problem:

1. Identify adjacent numbers with the same value as part of the same object. In this case, we can see that there are several instances where this occurs (e.g., [2, 3, 2, 3, 2] in the first input grid).
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. For example, in the first input grid, we have a sequence of 0s and 2s that seem to be separated by a gap, indicating that they might not be part of the same object.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. In the second input grid, for instance, there are four 1s in each row, which can be counted as a group.
4. Be attentive to tasks involving sorting objects. In the third input grid, we can see that the 6s and 1s are arranged in alternating rows, suggesting an order or sequence.

However, without more context or specific rules, it's difficult to determine the exact transformation for the last given input grid.
