Here's the reasoning for each option and then the chosen output:

Option 1:
- The input grid has a structure where the same number appears adjacent to each other, forming objects. For example, the object with 7s along the top and bottom edges (rows 2 and 8) seems persistent throughout the grid. However, this pattern does not seem to apply consistently across the entire grid.
- The input grid also has a structure where there are isolated groups of numbers, like the group of 5s in the middle (columns 4 to 6). This pattern is consistent across the entire grid.
- Based on these observations, it's unclear how to apply the transformation rule consistently across the entire grid. Thus, option 1 is not chosen.

Option 2:
- The input grid has a structure where the same number appears adjacent to each other, forming objects. For example, the object with 7s along the top and bottom edges (rows 2 and 8) seems persistent throughout the grid. This pattern can be applied consistently across the entire grid.
- However, this option doesn't take into account the isolated groups of numbers, like the group of 5s in the middle (columns 4 to 6). The transformation rule does not seem to apply consistently to these objects.
- Based on these observations, it's unclear how to apply the transformation rule consistently across the entire grid. Thus, option 2 is not chosen.

Option 3:
- The input grid has a structure where there are isolated groups of numbers, like the group of 5s in the middle (columns 4 to 6). This pattern is consistent across the entire grid.
- However, this option does not take into account the objects with the same number appearing adjacent to each other, like the object with 7s along the top and bottom edges (rows 2 and 8). The transformation rule does not seem to apply consistently to these objects.
- Based on these observations, it's unclear how to apply the transformation rule consistently across the entire grid. Thus, option 3 is not chosen.

Since none of the options provide a clear and consistent transformation rule that can be applied to the entire input grid, it's difficult to determine an appropriate output grid for this case.
