Here's a step-by-step explanation of the transformation rule and how to apply it to the given input grid:

1. Identify objects by considering adjacent numbers with the same value. In this case, we have 5 as an object, and 7 as another object.
2. Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. There is no direct physical contact between 5 and 7 objects in the input grid.
3. Pay attention to object relationships, transformations, and persistence. The 5 objects are connected horizontally, while the 7 objects form a vertical column.
4. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. There are 5 columns of 5 objects and 2 rows of 7 objects.
5. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts. The 5 objects are arranged in a horizontal line, while the 7 objects are stacked vertically.
6. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one. In this case, we can rearrange the input grid by placing the 7 objects above the 5 objects to create a more symmetrical structure.
7. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs. The transformation rule holds true for the given cases.
8. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid. In this case, it remains the same size as the input grid.

Based on the transformation rule and reasoning above, here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]
  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]
