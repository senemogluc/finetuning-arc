Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies to all cases. However, we can try to analyze the patterns in the given cases to generate an output for the last input grid.

Last Input Grid:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

We can notice that the first and last rows are the same in all three cases. Also, the middle row (row 2) has a single value of 7 in each case. Based on this pattern, we can generate an output grid for the last input as follows:

Output Grid:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
