Given the transformation rules and the previous cases, it's difficult to determine a unique output for the last input without more context or constraints. The transformation rule emphasizes recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects, counting or sorting objects, comparing numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects, and applying basic arithmetic. However, the provided input does not have clear relationships between objects that would allow us to apply these rules. 

For instance, we could consider merging all adjacent groups of 7s into a single group, but this would be just one possible interpretation of the transformation rule. 

Here's an example of what the output might look like if we merge all adjacent groups of 7s:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]

However, this is just one possible interpretation, and there might be other valid outputs depending on the intended transformation rule.
