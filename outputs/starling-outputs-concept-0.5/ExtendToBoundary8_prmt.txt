Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects and their relationships: In this case, we have a series of 8s arranged in columns and rows. There are no other objects or numbers present.
2. Consider object transformations and persistence: The 8s remain unchanged throughout the input pairs.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for numerical aspects: No counting or arithmetic is needed in this case, as all the values are equal to 8.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: There's no need for geometric or topological considerations in this example, as the grid is flat and there are no holes or loops involved.
5. Check whether the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule holds true for all the given input-output pairs.

Based on these steps, the output grid for the last input should be the same as the input grid, with all values equal to 8:
