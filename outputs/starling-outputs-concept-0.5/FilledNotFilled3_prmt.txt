Given the input grid from Case 3:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 5]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]
```

Based on the transformation rules induced from previous cases, we can infer that:

1. The grid has a pattern of alternating values (2 and 8) in the first six rows, which are part of the same object.
2. In the last three rows, there is a pattern of alternating values (0, 5, and 5) in the second to last row, followed by a pattern of alternating values (5 and 3) in the last row. These patterns also represent the same objects.
3. There are no significant interactions between these objects, such as contact or translation.
4. The grid doesn't involve counting or sorting tasks directly.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the transformation rule is to maintain the alternating pattern of values in each row and remove any rows with only background (0) values. 

Applying this rule to the input grid, we get:

```
[0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
```

So the output of the last input grid is:

```
[8]
[2]
[2]
[2]
[2]
[2]
[5]
```
