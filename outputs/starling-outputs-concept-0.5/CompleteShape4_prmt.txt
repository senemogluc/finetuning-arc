Here's my reasoning for the transformation rule and the output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent numbers with the same value (e.g., 3-3-3).
2. Recognize tasks involving counting or sorting objects, such as finding the maximum number of consecutive 3s.
3. Apply basic arithmetic for numerical aspects (e.g., count the number of 3s in each row and column).
4. Use elementary geometry and topology concepts to determine the shape and size of objects (e.g., rectangular grid).
5. Check if the transformation rule works on previous input-output pairs.

Based on these steps, here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
