Here's my reasoning for each option and then I will pick one:

1. The transformation rule seems to involve counting the number of occurrences of a specific value in each row and column, and placing them in a way that maintains their relative positions. However, this doesn't seem to match the given input-output pairs exactly. 

2. Another possibility is that the transformation involves moving objects horizontally or vertically by a fixed distance, but again, this doesn't seem to align with the provided cases.

3. A third option could be that the transformation involves rotating the grid by a fixed angle, but once more, it doesn't match the input-output pairs. 

4. The last possibility is that the transformation involves reflecting the grid across a vertical or horizontal axis, which does seem to align with some of the provided cases. 

Based on this analysis, I believe that the correct transformation rule is reflection across a vertical axis for the first case and reflection across a horizontal axis for the second case. The third case doesn't seem to have a clear pattern, so I cannot determine the transformation rule for it. 

Output for Case 2:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
