Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. The first step is to identify any objects that are adjacent to each other with the same number (e.g., 0, 6). We can see a pair of 3's adjacent to each other in the input grid. So, we can merge these pairs into a single object with a count of 2:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. Next, we identify any objects that are adjacent to each other with the same number (e.g., 0, 0). We can see a pair of 0's adjacent to each other in the grid. So, we merge these pairs into a single object with a count of 1:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
   [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

3. Finally, we identify any objects that are adjacent to each other with the same number (e.g., 2, 2). We can see a pair of 2's adjacent to each other in the grid. So, we merge these pairs into a single object with a count of 1:
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
   [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Output Grid:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
