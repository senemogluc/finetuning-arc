Here are my reasoning steps for each option and then picking one:

1. Case 0: 
   - The input grid consists of a large rectangle of the same number (2) surrounded by zeros, with smaller rectangles of the same number (0) inside it. 
   - There is no clear transformation rule based on physical contact or counting/sorting objects. 
   - Based on the given priors, we can consider the objects as persisting despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects, but there is no clear transformation occurring here. 
   - Therefore, I choose this case as it doesn't seem to have any obvious transformation rule based on the provided priors.

2. Case 1: 
   - The input grid consists of a large rectangle of zeros surrounded by a number (4) and another smaller rectangle inside it with the same number (3). 
   - There is no clear transformation rule based on physical contact or counting/sorting objects. 
   - Based on the given priors, we can consider the objects as persisting despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects, but there is no clear transformation occurring here. 
   - Therefore, I choose this case as it doesn't seem to have any obvious transformation rule based on the provided priors.

3. Case 2: 
   - The input grid consists of a large rectangle of zeros surrounded by a number (6) and another smaller rectangle inside it with the same number (0). 
   - There is no clear transformation rule based on physical contact or counting/sorting objects. 
   - Based on the given priors, we can consider the objects as persisting despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects, but there is no clear transformation occurring here. 
   - Therefore, I choose this case as it doesn't seem to have any obvious transformation rule based on the provided priors.

4. Case 3: 
   - The input grid consists of a large rectangle of zeros surrounded by a number (5) and another smaller rectangle inside it with the same number (0). 
   - There is no clear transformation rule based on physical contact or counting/sorting objects. 
   - Based on the given priors, we can consider the objects as persisting despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects, but there is no clear transformation occurring here. 
   - Therefore, I choose this case as it doesn't seem to have any obvious transformation rule based on the provided priors.

Based on my reasoning, none of these cases seem to have an obvious transformation rule that can be induced from the given priors. However, since you asked for the output of the last input (Case 3), here is the output grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
