Based on the given priors and previous cases, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing objects with the same number adjacent to each other as part of the same object, persisting objects despite noise or occlusion, and considering tasks involving counting or sorting. 

For Case 3, the input grid has a large number of 3s arranged in a square pattern, surrounded by a background of 0s. The transformation rule suggests that we should group the adjacent 3s together as part of the same object and maintain their shape and position. 

To achieve this, we can create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid:

Output:
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid maintains the shape and position of the 3s while removing any noise or occlusion. The transformation rule also works on the previous input-output pairs, as observed in Cases 0, 1, and 2.
