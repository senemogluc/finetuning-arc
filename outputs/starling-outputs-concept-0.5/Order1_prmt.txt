Based on the given priors and previous input-output pairs, I will generate the output grid for the last provided input. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. Identify adjacent numbers that are part of the same object: In the input grid, we can see groups of 8s and 6s. The 4s are not part of any group with a larger number. Since there are no other objects with different values, we don't need to consider them for now.
2. Observe the transformation rule: We have two types of objects - objects with 8s and objects with 6s. The 8s form a rectangle shape, while the 6s form another rectangle shape. There are no interactions between these two shapes. 
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects: Counting the number of 8s and 6s in each row, we can see that there are four rows with three 8s and one row with only two 8s. Similarly, there are four rows with three 6s, and one row with only two 6s.
4. Recognize and leverage elementary geometry and topology concepts: The 8s form a rectangle shape with dimensions of 3x4, while the 6s form another rectangle shape with dimensions of 3x3. There are no rotations or rearrangements needed for these shapes.
5. Write down your reasoning for each option and then pick one: As there are no interactions between the two objects, we can simply move the 8s to the left by one column and the 6s to the top by one row. This way, we maintain the original dimensions of both objects while keeping them separated.
6. Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs: The transformation rule we derived is consistent with the previous cases provided.
7. Output grid can be smaller or larger than the input grid: In this case, the output grid is the same size as the input grid, 12x9.

Based on these steps and reasoning, here's the output grid for the last provided input:

```
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
