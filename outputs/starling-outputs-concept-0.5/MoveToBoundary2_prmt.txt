To determine the transformation rule for the given input and output pairs, we can analyze the patterns and relationships between the objects in each case. Here's a summary of the observations:

1. Objects with the same number adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
2. Objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects.
3. Tasks involving physical contact between objects, such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions.
4. Tasks involving counting or sorting objects, comparing numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule for the last input grid:

1. Identify and group adjacent objects with the same number.
2. Remove any noise or occlusion between objects while preserving their positions relative to each other.
3. Ensure that objects with different numbers are not merged into a single object.
4. Maintain the shape and size of each object.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the last input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the transformation rule has been applied to the last input grid, resulting in the same output as before.
