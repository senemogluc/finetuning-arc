Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects based on adjacent same numbers:
   - Object 1: [9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
   - Object 2: [9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9]
   - Object 3: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9]
   - Object 4: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]
   - Object 5: [9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
   - Object 6: [9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9]

2. Apply transformation rules:
   - Since there are no tasks involving physical contact or counting/sorting objects, we don't need to apply any specific transformations based on these rules.

3. Persist objects in the output grid:
   - Object 1: [5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0] (Object 2 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
   - Object 2: [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0] (Object 3 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
   - Object 3: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0] (Object 4 is rotated 180 degrees)
   - Object 4: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0] (Object 5 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
   - Object 5: [5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0] (Object 6 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
   - Object 6: [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0] (Object 1 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise)

4. Combine the persisted objects to form the output grid:

Output Grid:
  [5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]

The output grid for the last input is:
  [5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]
  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]
