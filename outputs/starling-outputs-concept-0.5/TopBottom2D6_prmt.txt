The transformation rule we have induced from previous cases involves recognizing and leveraging elementary geometry and topology concepts, paying attention to object relationships, transformations, and persistence, and applying counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects. 

In this case, the input grid has no continuous objects with identical values adjacent to each other. The only value present in the grid is 3, which appears twice horizontally and once vertically. We can consider these as separate objects. 

To generate the output grid for this case, we can place the number 3 in the center of the grid, as it is the most common value among the input grid. 

Here's the transformation:

Input:
```less
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Output:
```less
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
```

The output grid for the last input is:
```less
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
```
