Based on the given priors and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule for this case. The input grid appears to have no clear patterns or relationships between objects that can be inferred as priorities. Therefore, it's not possible to generate an output grid for this case with the provided information and transformation rules.

It's essential to have more context or information about the task or problem at hand to apply the appropriate transformation rule and generate a valid output grid.
