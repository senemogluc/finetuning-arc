To determine the transformation rule for the given cases, we can analyze each case and identify the common patterns or rules that are applied to transform the input grid into the output grid. Here's an analysis of each case:

Case 0:
This case seems to have a simple pattern where all occurrences of 3 are placed next to each other in the output grid, forming a vertical column. The background (0) is left unchanged.

Case 1:
In this case, the transformation rule appears to be placing the number 2 next to its neighbors if it's possible without violating any rules. The background (0) remains unchanged. There are no specific patterns or goals guiding the transformations in this case.

Case 2:
Here, the transformation rule seems to be duplicating the grid horizontally and placing all occurrences of 5 next to each other. Again, the background (0) is left unchanged.

Based on the analysis of these cases, we can infer that the transformation rules are as follows:

1. Place all occurrences of a specific number next to each other in the output grid.
2. Preserve the background (0).
3. The transformations may involve duplicating parts of the grid horizontally or vertically, depending on the case.

Now, let's apply these rules to the last input:

Input:
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Using the inferred transformation rules:
1. Place all occurrences of 5 next to each other in the output grid.
2. Preserve the background (0).
3. Duplicate the grid horizontally and place all occurrences of 5 next to each other.

Output:
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
  [5, 0, 5, 0, 5]
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 5]
