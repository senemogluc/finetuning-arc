Based on the provided transformations and the given inputs, it's challenging to determine a specific transformation rule that fits all cases. However, let's try to analyze each case separately and propose an appropriate transformation for the last input.

Case 0:
Here, we have two objects with color 5 surrounded by background (color 0). The transformation seems to be simply selecting the smallest non-background number in each object. So, in this case, the output would be [3, 2].

Case 1:
In this case, we can see that there are three objects with different colors (4, 1, and 6) surrounded by background (color 0). The transformation seems to be selecting the smallest non-background number in each object. So, in this case, the output would be [4, 1, 6, 8].

Case 2:
Similarly, we have three objects with different colors (2, 4, and 6) surrounded by background (color 0). The transformation seems to be selecting the smallest non-background number in each object. So, in this case, the output would be [2, 4, 6].

However, it's important to note that these transformations are based on a limited set of examples and may not be applicable to all cases or inputs.
