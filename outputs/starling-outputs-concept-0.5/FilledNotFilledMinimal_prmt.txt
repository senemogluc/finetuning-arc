Here's the reasoning for the transformation rule:

1. The grid represents a series of objects with different colors (numbers).
2. Objects that are adjacent to each other have the same color (number).
3. Objects persist despite noise or occlusion by other objects, and transformations may occur.
4. Physical contact between objects is important, such as translation, rebounding, or other interactions.
5. Counting or sorting objects might be involved, requiring comparison of numbers, sizes, and shapes.

Based on the given input grid and the transformation rule, the output grid should be:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid maintains the same structure as the input grid and follows the transformation rules.
