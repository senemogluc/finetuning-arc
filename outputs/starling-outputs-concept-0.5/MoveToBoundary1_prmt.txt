Based on the transformation rules and reasoning from previous cases, the output for the last input grid should be as follows:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]

In this case, there are no significant transformations needed as the input grid is relatively simple. The main focus is on maintaining the same number patterns and preserving objects despite noise or occlusion.
