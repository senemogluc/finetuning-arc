Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output:

1. Identify objects by same numbers adjacent to each other. In this case, we have:
   - Object 1: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0] with size 8x3
   - Object 2: [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6] with size 3x3

2. Determine the relationships between objects and their transformations. In this case, we have:
   - Object 1 is stationary and persists in its original form throughout the transformation.
   - Object 2 is also stationary but rotated by 90 degrees. The rotation can be represented as a 90-degree clockwise rotation matrix:
     R = [0, -1; 1, 0]
     Transformed object 2: [6, 0, -6; -6, 6, 0]

3. Apply the transformation to each object and combine them into a single grid:
   - Object 1: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
   - Transformed object 2: [6, 0, -6; -6, 6, 0]
   - Combined grid: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 6, 0, -6, -6, 6, 0]

4. Check if the transformation also works on previous input-output pairs. It does not seem to have any effect on the previous cases, so it's unlikely that this is the correct transformation for the last input.

Final Output:
  [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 6, 0, -6, -6, 6, 0]
