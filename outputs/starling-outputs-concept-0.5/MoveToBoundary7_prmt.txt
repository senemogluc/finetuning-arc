In this case, it's important to consider the priors and identify the goals or intentions guiding the transformations. The main goal here seems to be to separate the objects with the same color (8 and 7) and keep them in their original positions relative to each other.

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Separate the objects with the same color (8 and 7). In this case, we can notice that the 8s are arranged in a square shape, while the 7s are also arranged in a square shape but rotated by 90 degrees. So, we can separate them by rotating one of the squares. Let's rotate the 7s by 90 degrees clockwise:
   Input:
     [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   Rotated Output:
     [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. Now we can see that the objects have been separated based on their color:
   Rotated Output:
     [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

So, the output of the last input is:
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
