Here's my reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. Identify objects by grouping adjacent same-colored tiles in the input grid. This helps us understand the relationships between objects and their persistence through transformations.
2. Recognize that there are three main objects in the input grid, with colors 8, 7, and 4. They have distinct shapes and can be transformed independently of each other.
3. Apply counting and basic arithmetic to identify the number of instances of each object. In this case, we have 9 instances of color 8 (forming a 3x3 square), 12 instances of color 7 (forming a 4x3 rectangle with one additional instance outside the main rectangle), and 1 instance of color 4 (forming an isolated square).
4. Transform the objects based on their relationships, such as the translation of the 8-colored object to the bottom left corner of the output grid and the rearrangement of the 7-colored objects to form a 3x3 square in the center of the output grid. The 4-colored object remains unchanged.
5. Output grid:

   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 4, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7]
   [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7]

In this case, the output grid is larger than the input grid due to the transformations applied.
