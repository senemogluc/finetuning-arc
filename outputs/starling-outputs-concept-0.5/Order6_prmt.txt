Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process for each case and the generated outputs:

Case 0:
The transformation rule here seems to be focusing on preserving objects with same color adjacent to each other. The input grid shows multiple objects with the same colors (5, 2, 3, and 4) arranged in a square shape. When we look at the output grid, all these objects are preserved with their original shapes, but they are rearranged within the grid.

Case 1:
In this case, the transformation rule seems to be focused on preserving objects that have the same color and are adjacent to each other, regardless of the background or other objects. The input grid shows multiple objects with different colors (7, 1, 4, and 6) arranged in square shapes. When we look at the output grid, all these objects are preserved with their original shapes, but they are rearranged within the grid.

Case 2:
In this case, the transformation rule seems to be focused on preserving objects that have the same color and are adjacent to each other, regardless of the background or other objects. The input grid shows multiple objects with different colors (4, 3, and 7) arranged in square shapes. However, the object with color 6 is not part of a closed shape, so it's not preserved as an intact object in the output grid.

The last given input is from Case 2:
