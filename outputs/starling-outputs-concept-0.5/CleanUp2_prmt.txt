Here's the reasoning for each option and the final output grid:

1. The first step is to identify the objects in the input grid. In this case, we can see that all the 1s are part of a single object, and the 0s are part of another object. There are no other objects present in the grid.
2. Next, we need to look for any transformations or interactions between these objects. The main interaction is the presence of the 0s surrounding the 1s, which creates a border around the main object formed by the 1s. However, there are no significant transformations happening within the objects themselves (e.g., rotation, scaling, etc.).
3. Since there are no significant transformations or interactions between the objects, we can simply remove the 0s from the grid to obtain the output grid. The 1s will persist in their original form, as they are the primary object in the input grid.
4. Check whether this transformation also works on the previous input-output pairs. It does, as the 0s are removed from the grids while the 1s persist in their original form.
