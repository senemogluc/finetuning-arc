Here's a step-by-step explanation for each case:

Case 0:
The input grid consists of alternating rows of 2's and 3's. The transformation rule can be applied by recognizing that adjacent numbers with the same color (value) are part of the same object. In this case, we can see that the objects are formed by the alternation of 2's and 3's. By applying the transformation rule, we can remove the 2's from each row where they appear, leaving only the 3's. The output grid will have a similar structure as the input grid, but with the 2's removed.

Case 1:
The input grid consists of alternating rows of 4's and 0's. Similar to Case 0, we can apply the transformation rule by recognizing that adjacent numbers with the same color (value) are part of the same object. In this case, we can see that the objects are formed by the alternation of 4's and 0's. By applying the transformation rule, we can remove the 4's from each row where they appear, leaving only the 0's. The output grid will have a similar structure as the input grid, but with the 4's removed.

Case 2:
The input grid consists of alternating rows of 9's and 0's. Similar to the previous cases, we can apply the transformation rule by recognizing that adjacent numbers with the same color (value) are part of the same object. In this case, we can see that the objects are formed by the alternation of 9's and 0's. By applying the transformation rule, we can remove the 9's from each row where they appear, leaving only the 0's. The output grid will have a similar structure as the input grid, but with the 9's removed.

Case 3:
The input grid consists of alternating rows of 1's and 0's. Similar to the previous cases, we can apply the transformation rule by recognizing that adjacent numbers with the same color (value) are part of the same object. In this case, we can see that the objects are formed by the alternation of 1's and 0's. By applying the transformation rule, we can remove the 1's from each row where they appear, leaving only the 0's. The output grid will have a similar structure as the input grid, but with the 1's removed.

For Case 3, the output grid should be:

  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
