Here's the reasoning for each step and the final transformation rule:

1. Analyze the given cases to identify patterns and relationships between objects. In all cases, we have a grid with identical rows and columns on both sides of a central block. The central block contains unique values that are not present in the surrounding rows or columns. 

2. Identify the transformation rule by considering the priors:
   - Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object.
   - Objects persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects. In many cases, objects from the input persist on the output grid, often in a transformed form.
   - Recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects. This may include translation, rebounding, or other interactions between elements. 
   - Be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects. Compare numbers, sizes, and shapes of objects.

3. Based on the analysis, we can infer that the transformation rule is as follows:
   - The central block (the unique values) remains unchanged.
   - The surrounding rows and columns are replaced with a single value from the central block, alternating between the top-left and bottom-right values.
   
4. Apply the transformation rule to the last input grid:

Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ...
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the transformation rule is applied to the entire grid, resulting in an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
