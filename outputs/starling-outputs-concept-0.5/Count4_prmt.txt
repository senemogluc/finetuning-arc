After analyzing the given priors and previous input-output pairs, I will now generate the output grid that corresponds to the last given input grid.

Last Input Grid:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output Grid:

[0]
