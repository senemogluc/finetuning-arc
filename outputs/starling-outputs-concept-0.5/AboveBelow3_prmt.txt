Based on the given transformation rules and previous cases, it's difficult to determine a specific output for the last input without more context or information about the desired transformation. The task seems to involve recognizing and leveraging elementary geometry and topology concepts, as well as identifying goals or intentions guiding the transformations. However, with only one input provided, it's not possible to generate an appropriate output grid that adheres to the stated rules.

To provide a more accurate output, please provide additional context or information about the desired transformation, or consider providing multiple input-output pairs to help identify patterns and apply the transformation rules more effectively.
