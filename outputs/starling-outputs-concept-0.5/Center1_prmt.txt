Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to derive the transformation rule and apply it to the given input grid.

1. Identify the priors: In this case, we have three main priorities - same numbers forming objects, persistence of objects despite noise or occlusion, and recognition of tasks involving physical contact between objects.
2. Analyze the input grids: We are given three cases with different input grids. In each case, we can observe that the 3's form rectangular blocks, but they are not connected in a single continuous block. There is no apparent task involving counting or sorting, and there is no clear indication of physical contact between objects.
3. Apply the transformation rule: Based on the given priors, it seems reasonable to assume that the 3's should be grouped together into larger rectangular blocks. However, since the 3's are not connected in a single continuous block, we can only create smaller rectangular blocks from them.
4. Generate the output grid: Following step 3, we can create the following rectangular blocks from the given input grid:

   Case 0:
   1. [0, 3, 3]
   2. [3, 3, 3]
   3. [3, 3, 3]
   4. [3, 3, 3]

   Case 1:
   1. [0, 4, 4]
   2. [4, 4, 4]
   3. [4, 4, 4]
   4. [4, 4, 4]

   Case 2:
   1. [0, 2, 2]
   2. [2, 2, 2]
   3. [2, 2, 2]

5. Apply the transformation rule to the last input grid (Case 2): Based on the analysis in step 4, we can create two rectangular blocks from the given input grid:

   Output Grid:
   
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In conclusion, the output of the last input grid (Case 2) is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
