Based on the transformation rule induced from the previous input-output pairs, we can generate the following Output grid for the last given Input grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid has the same size as the input grid and maintains the structure of the objects present in the input grid.
