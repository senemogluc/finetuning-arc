Based on the provided priors and previous input-output pairs, it's difficult to determine a specific transformation rule that applies universally. However, I can provide an analysis of each case and suggest possible transformations for the last input grid.

Case 0:
In this case, it seems like the grid is composed of multiple instances of the same object (3x3 squares) with a background of zeros. The transformation rule could be that objects are preserved in their original form, but the number of occurrences might change. In this case, the output grid remains the same as the input grid since there are no changes or transformations happening.

Case 1:
In this case, we have a series of connected 3x2 squares with value 2. The transformation rule could be that objects are preserved in their original form, but the number of occurrences might change. In this case, there is an additional row of zeros added at the bottom, creating a grid with one more row than the input grid.

Case 2:
In this case, we have a series of connected 3x7 squares with value 6. The transformation rule could be that objects are preserved in their original form, but the number of occurrences might change. In this case, there is an additional column of zeros added at the right side, creating a grid with one more column than the input grid.

For the last input grid (Case 3):
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the previous cases and transformation rules, it's reasonable to assume that the output grid will have a similar structure. The transformation rule could be that objects are preserved in their original form, but the number of occurrences might change. In this case, we can create an output grid with one more row and column than the input grid:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
