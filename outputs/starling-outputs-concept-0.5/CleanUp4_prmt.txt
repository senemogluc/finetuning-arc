Based on the provided inputs and transformations, it's difficult to determine a specific output for the last input. The transformation rules seem to involve recognizing objects, counting, basic arithmetic, and geometry but the given inputs do not provide enough context or information to apply these rules consistently. 

To generate an output grid for the last input, we would need more information about the intended transformations and relationships between the elements in the grid.
