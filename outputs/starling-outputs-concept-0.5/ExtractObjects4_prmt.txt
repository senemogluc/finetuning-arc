To determine the transformation rule for the given inputs and outputs, let's analyze the patterns in the previous cases:

Case 0: The input grid consists of a pattern of 2x2 squares with the number 2. The transformation rule seems to be removing all but one occurrence of the same number that is part of the same object (adjacent to each other). This results in a single 2x2 square with the number 2 in the center.

Case 1: The input grid consists of a pattern of 3x3 squares with the number 6. The transformation rule seems to be removing all but one occurrence of the same number that is part of the same object (adjacent to each other). This results in a single 3x3 square with the number 6 in the center.

Case 2: The input grid consists of a pattern of 4x4 squares with the number 4. The transformation rule seems to be removing all but one occurrence of the same number that is part of the same object (adjacent to each other). This results in a single 4x4 square with the number 4 in the center.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the last input:

Input:
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Output:
  [8, 8, 8]
  [8, 8, 8]

The transformation rule we induced from the previous cases is applied to the last input grid. The output grid now consists of a single 3x3 square with the number 8 in the center.
