Here are my reasoning steps for each case:

Case 0:
1. The grid consists of multiple objects with the same number (3) appearing in a block-like pattern. These blocks seem to be connected horizontally and vertically.
2. The background is represented by the value 0, which separates these objects from each other.
3. There are no specific tasks involving counting, sorting, or physical contact between objects.
4. Since the grid consists of only one type of object (with the same number 3), we can consider the entire grid as a single object.
5. The transformation rule for this case is to keep all the values unchanged because there are no specific tasks or interactions between objects.

Case 1:
1. The grid consists of multiple objects with different numbers (0-9). These objects seem to be connected horizontally and vertically, forming a rectangular pattern.
2. The background is represented by the value 0, which separates these objects from each other.
3. There are specific tasks involving counting (e.g., finding the number of 6's or 8's) and sorting (e.g., arranging the numbers in ascending order).
4. The transformation rule for this case is to count the occurrences of each number and arrange them in ascending order, filling the grid with the new pattern.
5. After applying the transformation rule, we get the output grid as mentioned in the problem statement.

Case 2:
1. The grid consists of multiple objects with different numbers (3-9). These objects seem to be connected horizontally and vertically, forming a rectangular pattern.
2. The background is represented by the value 0, which separates these objects from each other.
3. There are specific tasks involving counting (e.g., finding the number of 6's or 9's) and sorting (e.g., arranging the numbers in ascending order).
4. The transformation rule for this case is to count the occurrences of each number and arrange them in ascending order, filling the grid with the new pattern.
5. After applying the transformation rule, we get the output grid as mentioned in the problem statement.

For the last input of Case 2:

Since the transformation rule for this case is to count the occurrences of each number and arrange them in ascending order, filling the grid with the new pattern, we can apply the same logic to find the output grid. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Count the occurrences of each number: 
   - 3: 4 times (top left, top right, middle left, middle right)
   - 6: 2 times (middle bottom, bottom left)
   - 9: 2 times (bottom right, bottom center)

2. Arrange the numbers in ascending order and fill the grid accordingly:
   [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
   [3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   [3, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output grid for the last input of Case 2 is:

  [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
  [3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
