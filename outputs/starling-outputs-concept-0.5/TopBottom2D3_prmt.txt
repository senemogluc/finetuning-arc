Here's a reasoning breakdown for each case:

Case 0:
- The grid has a central block of 3x6 squares filled with color 4. It's surrounded by a border of color 2 on all sides. The central block is symmetric, and the border is also symmetric along the vertical axis. We can think of this as a transformation that mirrors the central block horizontally and fills in the border with a lower-value color (2 instead of 4).
- Transformation: Mirror the central block horizontally and fill in the border with color 2.

Case 1:
- The grid has a central block of 3x6 squares filled with color 7. It's surrounded by a border of color 2 on all sides. The central block is symmetric, and the border is also symmetric along the vertical axis. We can think of this as a transformation that mirrors the central block horizontally and fills in the border with a lower-value color (2 instead of 7).
- Transformation: Mirror the central block horizontally and fill in the border with color 2.

Case 2:
- The grid has a central block of 3x6 squares filled with color 3. It's surrounded by a border of color 0 on all sides. The central block is symmetric, and the border is also symmetric along the vertical axis. We can think of this as a transformation that mirrors the central block horizontally and fills in the border with a lower-value color (0 instead of 3).
- Transformation: Mirror the central block horizontally and fill in the border with color 0.

Case 3:
- The grid has a central block of 3x6 squares filled with color 5. It's surrounded by a border of color 0 on all sides. The central block is symmetric, and the border is also symmetric along the vertical axis. We can think of this as a transformation that mirrors the central block horizontally and fills in the border with a lower-value color (0 instead of 5).
- Transformation: Mirror the central block horizontally and fill in the border with color 0.

For the last input, the output grid should be:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's a summary of the transformations for each case:

1. Case 0: Mirror the central block horizontally and fill in the border with color 2.
2. Case 1: Mirror the central block horizontally and fill in the border with color 2.
3. Case 2: Mirror the central block horizontally and fill in the border with color 0.
4. Case 3: Mirror the central block horizontally and fill in the border with color 0.
