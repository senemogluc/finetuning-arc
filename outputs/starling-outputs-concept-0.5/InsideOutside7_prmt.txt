Based on the previous cases and priors, we can infer that the transformation rule involves recognizing tasks involving physical contact between objects, object persistence, and counting or sorting objects. In this case, the last input grid seems to have a pattern where the numbers 1 appear in groups of three connected by horizontal lines, and the number 3 appears in groups of three connected by vertical lines.

To find the output grid, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the connected components of the input grid.
2. Count the occurrences of each number (1 and 3) within the connected components.
3. Create an output grid with only the connected components containing at least one instance of the numbers 1 or 3.
4. If a connected component has both 1s and 3s, place it in the output grid twice, once for each number.
5. Remove any remaining disconnected components from the output grid.

Following these steps, we get the following output grid:

Output:
  [1, 1, 3, 3]
