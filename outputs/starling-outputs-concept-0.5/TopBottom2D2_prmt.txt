Case 3:
Input:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output:
  [7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7]

In this case, the transformation rule is to group all the adjacent 5's and 7's together. The output grid is formed by connecting all the 5's and 7's horizontally and vertically, creating a single object for each number.
