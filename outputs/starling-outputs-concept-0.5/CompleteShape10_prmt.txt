Here's the reasoning for each step and the final output grid:

1. The first row consists of all zeros, which means it is not part of any object. So, we can ignore this row in our transformation.
2. The second row has two 2's adjacent to each other, forming a single object. We can merge these two 2's into one object.
3. The third row also has two 2's adjacent to each other. Merge them as well.
4. The fourth and fifth rows have two 2's adjacent to each other in the same column. Merge these pairs of 2's.
5. The sixth row has a pair of 2's adjacent to each other, but they are not part of the same object from the previous rows. Leave them as is.
6. The seventh and eighth rows have two 2's adjacent to each other in the same column. Merge these pairs of 2's.
7. The ninth row has a pair of 2's adjacent to each other, but they are not part of the same object from previous rows. Leave them as is.

Based on this reasoning, here's the output grid for the last input:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
