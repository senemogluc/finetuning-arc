The transformation rule we induced from previous pairs involves recognizing tasks that involve counting or sorting objects. In this case, we can see that there are two main objects in the input grid: a set of 8x8 squares with the value 3 and a background of zeros.

To apply the transformation rule, we need to consider the counting aspect of the task. The main object (the set of 8x8 squares) has the value 3, which is repeated multiple times in each row. In order to obtain an output grid that represents this pattern, we can replace all occurrences of the value 3 with a single 4 and remove the background zeros.

Here's the reasoning for the last input:

1. Identify the main object (the set of 8x8 squares with the value 3) and the background (zeros).
2. Replace all occurrences of the value 3 with a single 4 within the main object, preserving its shape and size.
3. Remove the background zeros from the output grid.

Based on this reasoning, here's the output grid for the last input:

[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This output grid represents the transformation rule applied to the last input, maintaining the shape and size of the main object while removing the background zeros.
