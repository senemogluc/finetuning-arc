Here's a brief analysis of each case to understand the transformation rules:

Case 0: The input grid has two separate 5x5 blocks. In the output grid, the second block (top-right) is rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise while maintaining its shape and position relative to the first block.

Case 1: The input grid consists of two 5x5 blocks arranged vertically. In the output grid, the top block's shape is preserved, but it is shifted downward to make room for the bottom block, which remains in place. Both blocks maintain their relative positions and shapes.

Case 2: The input grid has a single 5x5 block with a smaller 1x5 block adjacent to it horizontally. In the output grid, the smaller block is shifted one position to the right, while the larger block remains in place.

Case 3: The input grid consists of two 5x5 blocks arranged vertically. In the output grid, both blocks maintain their relative positions and shapes, but the top block is rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

Case 4: The input grid has a single 5x5 block with a smaller 1x5 block adjacent to it horizontally. In the output grid, the smaller block is shifted one position to the right, while the larger block remains in place.

Now, let's analyze the last input grid and apply the learned transformation rules:

Last Input Grid:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the analysis and transformation rules, we can infer that the output grid should be a rotation of the input grid. In this case, rotating the grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise results in:

Output Grid:
[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
