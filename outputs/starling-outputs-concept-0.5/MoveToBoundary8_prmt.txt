Here are the steps I would follow to determine the transformation rule and generate the output grid for the last input:

1. Analyze the priors: Same numbers that are adjacent to each other are part of the same object, objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects, recognize tasks involving physical contact between objects, and be attentive to tasks involving counting or sorting objects.
2. Identify the main components in the input grid: In this case, there are two primary objects with the number 7 (located at positions [1][5] and [3][5]). There is also a single object with the number 1 (located at position [6][4]). The background is represented by zeros.
3. Apply the transformation rules: Since the numbers 7 are adjacent to each other, they can be merged into a single object. Similarly, the number 1 is adjacent to the first 7 and can also be merged with it. As a result, the output grid will have two objects with the number 8 (located at positions [1][5] and [3][5]).
4. Generate the output grid: Based on the transformed objects, the output grid would look like this:

Output:
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

So, the output of the last input is:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
