Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the solutions for the test cases:

Case 0:
To get the output, we need to find the minimum value of each row and then add it to the corresponding index of that row. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 8, so the output for the first row is [0, 2, 2]. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 8, so the output for the second row is [2, 0, 2]. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 8, so the output for the third row is [2, 2, 2]. 

Case 1:
To get the output, we need to find the minimum value of each row and then add it to the corresponding index of that row. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 0, so the output for the first row is [1, 1, 0]. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 0, so the output for the second row is [1, 0, 1]. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 0, so the output for the third row is [0, 1, 1]. 

Case 2:
To get the output, we need to find the minimum value of each row and then add it to the corresponding index of that row. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 5, so the output for the first row is [0, 4, 4]. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 5, so the output for the second row is [0, 0, 4]. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 5, so the output for the third row is [0, 4, 4]. 

Case 3:
To get the output, we need to find the minimum value of each row and then add it to the corresponding index of that row. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 5, so the output for the first row is [0, 0, 0]. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 0, so the output for the second row is [4, 4, 0]. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 0, so the output for the third row is [4, 4, 4]. 

Case 4:
To get the output, we need to find the minimum value of each row and then add it to the corresponding index of that row. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 8, so the output for the first row is [2, 0, 2]. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 8, so the output for the second row is [2, 0, 2]. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 8, so the output for the third row is [0, 2, 2]. 

Case 5:
To get the output, we need to find the minimum value of each row and then add it to the corresponding index of that row. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 8, so the output for the first row is [0, 2, 0]. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 8, so the output for the second row is [2, 0, 2]. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 8, so the output for the third row is [2, 0, 2]. 

Test Case:
To get the output, we need to find the minimum value of each row and then add it to the corresponding index of that row. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 3, so the output for the first row is [0, 1, 0]. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 3, so the output for the second row is [1, 0, 1]. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 3, so the output for the third row is [0, 1, 1]. 

Therefore, the output for the test case is [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]].
