GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[0, 3, 0], [0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 1, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
The input is a 2D array with 3 rows and 3 columns. Each element in the array is either 0 or a positive integer. The output is a 3D array with 3 rows, 3 columns, and 6 layers. Each element in the output array is either 0 or a positive integer. The output is constructed by repeating the input array horizontally 3 times and then concatenating the resulting 3 rows into a 3D array.

Case 1:
The input is a 2D array with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each element in the array is either 0 or a positive integer. The output is a 3D array with 4 rows, 4 columns, and 10 layers. Each element in the output array is either 0 or a positive integer. The output is constructed by repeating the input array horizontally 10 times and then concatenating the resulting 4 rows into a 3D array.

Test Case:
The input is a 2D array with 5 rows and 5 columns. Each element in the array is either 0 or a positive integer. The output is a 3D array with 5 rows, 5 columns, and 10 layers. Each element in the output array is either 0 or a positive integer. The output is constructed by repeating the input array horizontally 10 times and then concatenating the resulting 5 rows into a 3D array.

In summary, the algorithm takes a 2D array as input and constructs a 3D array by repeating the input array horizontally a certain number of times and then concatenating the resulting rows into a 3D array. The number of times the input array is repeated horizontally is equal to the maximum number of rows or columns in the input array.
