Explanation: 

In the given input, we have multiple sublists of integers. We need to identify the sublists that have the same elements in the same order. 

For Case 1: 

- The sublists [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] and [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] are the same, but in a different order. 

For Case 2:

- The sublists [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8] and [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8] and [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 

For Case 3:

- The sublists [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8] and [8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] and [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 

For the Test Case:

- The sublists [8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8] and [8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] and [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] and [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9] and [4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7] and [2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7] and [2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7] are the same, but in a different order. 

- The sublists [1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 

- The sublists [1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8] are the same, but in a different order. 
- The sublists [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] are the same, but in a different order.

The output for the test case is [[8, 7, 8, 4], [3, 3, 1, 2], [4, 4, 4, 3], [2, 6, 1, 5], [1, 5, 2]].
