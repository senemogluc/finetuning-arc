Case 0:
In the given input, we have three matrices. We need to update the matrices based on the following rules:
- If the element in the current matrix is 0, we can ignore it.
- If the element in the current matrix is 1, we can replace it with the corresponding element in the next matrix if it is non-zero. Otherwise, we can ignore it.
- If the element in the current matrix is 2, we can replace it with the sum of the corresponding elements in the next two matrices. If any of the corresponding elements in the next two matrices is 0, we can ignore it.

Following these rules, we can update the matrices as follows:

Matrix 1:
- The first element (0) stays the same.
- The second element (2) becomes 1 (from the next matrix).
- The third element (0) stays the same.
- The fourth element (1) becomes 1 (from the next matrix).
- The fifth element (0) stays the same.
- The sixth element (0) stays the same.
- The seventh element (0) stays the same.
- The eighth element (1) becomes 2 (from the next matrix).
- The ninth element (0) stays the same.
- The tenth element (2) becomes 2 (from the next matrix).
- The eleventh element (2) becomes 2 (from the next matrix).

Matrix 2:
- The first element (2) stays the same.
- The second element (2) becomes 0 (since the corresponding element in the next matrix is 0).
- The third element (0) stays the same.
- The fourth element (0) stays the same.
- The fifth element (0) stays the same.
- The sixth element (1) becomes 2 (from the next matrix).
- The seventh element (2) becomes 2 (from the next matrix).
- The eighth element (0) stays the same.
- The ninth element (0) stays the same.
- The tenth element (0) stays the same.
- The eleventh element (2) becomes 2 (from the next matrix).

Matrix 3:
- The first element (0) stays the same.
- The second element (0) stays the same.
- The third element (0) stays the same.
- The fourth element (1) becomes 0 (since the corresponding element in the next matrix is 0).
- The fifth element (0) stays the same.
- The sixth element (0) stays the same.
- The seventh element (0) stays the same.
- The eighth element (0) stays the same.
- The ninth element (0) stays the same.
- The tenth element (0) stays the same.
- The eleventh element (0) stays the same.

Output:
[[0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
