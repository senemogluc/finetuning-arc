Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
The input matrix is a 9x9 matrix with all zeros except for a few non-zero values in specific positions. The output matrix is obtained by replacing all the non-zero values in the input matrix with 8, and then compressing the matrix to only include the positions with 8. The resulting matrix is:

[[0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]

Case 1:
The input matrix is a 9x9 matrix with all zeros except for a few non-zero values in specific positions. The output matrix is obtained by replacing all the non-zero values in the input matrix with 8, and then compressing the matrix to only include the positions with 8. The resulting matrix is:

[[0, 8, 0], [8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8]]

Case 2:
The input matrix is a 9x9 matrix with all zeros except for a few non-zero values in specific positions. The output matrix is obtained by replacing all the non-zero values in the input matrix with 8, and then compressing the matrix to only include the positions with 8. The resulting matrix is:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]]

Case 3:
The input matrix is a 9x9 matrix with all zeros except for a few non-zero values in specific positions. The output matrix is obtained by replacing all the non-zero values in the input matrix with 8, and then compressing the matrix to only include the positions with 8. The resulting matrix is:

[[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]]

Case 4:
The input matrix is a 9x9 matrix with all zeros except for a few non-zero values in specific positions. The output matrix is obtained by replacing all the non-zero values in the input matrix with 8, and then compressing the matrix to only include the positions with 8. The resulting matrix is:

[[0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]

Test Case:
The input matrix is a 9x9 matrix with all zeros except for a few non-zero values in specific positions. The output matrix is obtained by replacing all the non-zero values in the input matrix with 8, and then compressing the matrix to only include the positions with 8. The resulting matrix is:

[[0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]]
