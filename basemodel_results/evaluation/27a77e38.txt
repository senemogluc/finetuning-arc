Explanation: 
In this problem, we are given a matrix and we need to replace all the zeros in the matrix with the smallest non-zero value in the same column. 

For the first test case, the smallest non-zero values in the columns with zeros are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. So, the zeros in the matrix are replaced with these values.

For the second test case, the smallest non-zero values in the columns with zeros are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. So, the zeros in the matrix are replaced with these values.

For the third test case, the smallest non-zero values in the columns with zeros are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. So, the zeros in the matrix are replaced with these values. 

The output matrices are obtained by replacing the zeros in the input matrices with the smallest non-zero values in the same column.
