GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 7]]

Output:
[[0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[7, 7, 0], [0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]]

Explanation: 
In each case, the input is a 3x3 matrix where all the elements are either 0 or 7. 
To transform the input matrix into the desired output matrix, we need to repeat each element in the matrix horizontally and vertically. 

For Case 0, we have the following steps:
1. Repeat the first row horizontally to get [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0].
2. Repeat the second row horizontally to get [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0].
3. Repeat the third row horizontally to get [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0].
4. Concatenate these three rows to get the desired output matrix.

For Case 1, we have the following steps:
1. Repeat the first row horizontally to get [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
2. Repeat the second row horizontally to get [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0].
3. Repeat the third row horizontally to get [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
4. Concatenate these three rows to get the desired output matrix.

For Case 2, we have the following steps:
1. Repeat the first row horizontally to get [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
2. Repeat the second row horizontally to get [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7].
3. Repeat the third row horizontally to get [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
4. Concatenate these three rows to get the desired output matrix.

For the test case, we have the following steps:
1. Repeat the first row horizontally to get [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0].
2. Repeat the second row horizontally to get [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0].
3. Repeat the third row horizontally to get [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0].
4. Concatenate these three rows to get the desired output matrix.
