Explanation:

In each case, the input is a 2D list of integers. The output is a new 2D list of integers, where each element in the output is the same as the corresponding element in the input, except for the specified positions, which are modified according to the rules described in the problem statement.

For example, in Case 0, all elements are set to 9. In Case 1, the elements at positions (i, i) are set to 8, and the elements at positions (i, i+1) are set to 8. In Case 2, the elements at positions (i, i) are set to 8, and the elements at positions (i+1, i) are set to 8. And so on, for each case.

To solve this problem, you can iterate through each element in the input list and apply the specified rules to modify the element. After modifying all the elements, the resulting list is the output.

Here's a Python function that takes the input and returns the output for each case:

```python
def modify_list(input_list):
    output_list = []
    for i in range(len(input_list)):
        row = input_list[i]
        output_row = []
        for j in range(len(row)):
            if i == j:
                output_row.append(8)
            elif i + 1 == j:
                output_row.append(8)
            elif i == j + 1:
                output_row.append(8)
            else:
                output_row.append(row[j])
        output_list.append(output_row)
    return output_list
```

You can use this function to solve each case by passing the corresponding input list to it. For example, to solve Case 0, you can use the following code:

```python
input_list = [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9], [9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9], [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]

output_list = modify_list(input_list)
print(output_list)
```

This will print the output for each case, as shown in the problem statement.
