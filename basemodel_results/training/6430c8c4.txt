Case 0:
In this case, we have the input matrix:

```
[[7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2]]
```

We can observe that the first and fourth rows have all zeros in the first and fourth columns. So, we can replace those rows with zeros in the output matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Case 1:
In this case, the input matrix is:

```

Here, the second and third rows have all zeros in the first and third columns. So, we can replace those rows with zeros in the output matrix:

```
[[0, 3, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 3]]

```

Here, the first and third rows have all zeros in the second and fourth columns. So, we can replace those rows with zeros in the output matrix:

```

Here, all the rows have all zeros in the second and fourth columns. So, we can replace the entire matrix with zeros in the output matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
