Explanation: 
In each case, we are given a 3x3 matrix where each element is either 1 or 2. 
We need to transform the matrix such that all the elements in each row are the same, and the value of the element is the smallest prime number that is greater than the current element in that row. 

For case 0, we replace all the 2's in the first row with 5's, all the 2's in the second row with 5's, and all the 2's in the third row with 5's. 

For case 1, we replace all the 1's in the first row with 5's, all the 1's in the second row with 5's, and all the 2's in the third row with 5's. 

For case 2, we replace all the 2's in the first and third rows with 5's, and leave the second row unchanged. 

For case 3, we replace all the 3's in the first and third rows with 5's, and leave the second row unchanged. 

For the test case, we replace all the 3's in the first and second rows with 5's, and leave the third row unchanged. 

In all cases, the output is a matrix where all the elements in each row are the same, and the value of the element is the smallest prime number that is greater than the current element in that row.
