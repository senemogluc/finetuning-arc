Test Case:
Input:
[[0, 6, 6, 0, 8], [0, 6, 6, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [8, 8, 1, 7, 9]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here's the solution to the given test case:

To solve this problem, we can follow the same logic as in the previous cases. We start by initializing an empty matrix of the same size as the input matrix. Then, for each element in the input matrix, we check its value and update the corresponding elements in the output matrix accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty matrix of size (5, 5) with all elements set to 0.
2. Iterate through the input matrix and update the output matrix based on the value of each element:
   - If the element is 0, leave it as it is.
   - If the element is 6, set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
   - If the element is 8, set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
   - If the element is 1, set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
   - If the element is 7, set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
   - If the element is 9, set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
3. Once all elements have been processed, return the output matrix.

Applying this logic to the given test case:

Input: [[0, 6, 6, 0, 8], [0, 6, 6, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [8, 8, 1, 7, 9]]

Output:

1. Initialize an empty matrix of size (5, 5) with all elements set to 0.
   [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

2. Update the output matrix based on the values in the input matrix:
   - Element 6: Set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   - Element 6: Set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   - Element 8: Set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   - Element 1: Set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   - Element 7: Set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   - Element 9: Set the corresponding elements in the output matrix to 0 and increment the value of the element by 1.
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

3. Return the output matrix:
   [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

So, the output for the given test case is:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
