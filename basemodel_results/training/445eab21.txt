Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[3, 3], [3, 3]]

Explanation: 
The given input is a 2D matrix. We need to find the maximum occurrence of a number in each row and return a 2D matrix with those maximum occurrences. 

In the first case, the maximum occurrence of 8 is in the rows 5, 6, 7, and 8. So, the output is [[8, 8], [8, 8]].
In the second case, the maximum occurrence of 7 is in the rows 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. So, the output is [[7, 7], [7, 7]].
In the third case, the maximum occurrence of 4 is in the rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, the output is [[4, 4], [4, 4]].

In the test case, the maximum occurrence of 9 is in the rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. So, the output is [[3, 3], [3, 3]].
