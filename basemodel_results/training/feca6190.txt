Test Case:
Input:
[[0, 6, 7, 8, 9]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the first few steps of the solution:

1. Initialize a 2D matrix with all zeros, with dimensions 10x10 (since the maximum value in the input is 9, we need a matrix of size 10x10 to accommodate all the values).
2. Iterate through the input matrix, and for each non-zero value, perform the following steps:
   a. Take the value and move it one step to the right (wrap around if it goes out of bounds).
   b. If the destination cell is already occupied by a non-zero value, move that value one step to the right (again, wrap around if necessary). Repeat this step until the destination cell is empty.
3. Repeat step 2 for all non-zero values in the input matrix.
4. The resulting 2D matrix represents the output.

Here's the solution for the test case:

Input: [[0, 6, 7, 8, 9]]

1. Initialize a 2D matrix with all zeros, of size 10x10.
2. Iterate through the input matrix:
   - For the value 6, move it one step to the right, resulting in an empty cell at its original position. Since no other value occupies the destination cell, we don't need to perform step 2.
   - For the value 7, move it one step to the right, resulting in an empty cell at its original position. The destination cell is already occupied by a zero, so we don't need to perform step 2.
   - For the value 8, move it one step to the right, resulting in an empty cell at its original position. The destination cell is already occupied by a zero, so we don't need to perform step 2.
   - For the value 9, move it one step to the right, resulting in an empty cell at its original position. The destination cell is already occupied by a zero, so we don't need to perform step 2.
3. No need to repeat step 2, as all non-zero values have been moved to the right.
4. The resulting 2D matrix is:

   [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
