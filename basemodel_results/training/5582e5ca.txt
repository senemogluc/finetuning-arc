GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[4, 4, 8], [6, 4, 3], [6, 3, 0]]

Output:
[[4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[6, 8, 9], [1, 8, 1], [9, 4, 9]]

Output:
[[9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[4, 6, 9], [6, 4, 1], [8, 8, 6]]

Output:
[[6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[8, 8, 6], [4, 6, 9], [8, 3, 0]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]]

Explanation: 
In all the given cases, the input is a 3x3 matrix. In each case, the maximum value in each row is the same, and the output is a new 3x3 matrix where each element is the maximum value in its corresponding row of the input matrix. 

For case 0, the maximum value in each row is 4, so the output is a matrix with all elements equal to 4. 
For case 1, the maximum value in each row is 9, so the output is a matrix with all elements equal to 9. 
For case 2, the maximum value in each row is 6, so the output is a matrix with all elements equal to 6. 
For the test case, the maximum value in each row is 6, so the output is a matrix with all elements equal to 6.
