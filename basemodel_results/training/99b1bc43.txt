Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the solutions for each case:

Case 0:
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. We can calculate the sum of each column in the input matrix and then divide each column by 2. If the remainder is 1, we replace the corresponding column with 0; otherwise, we replace it with 1.

Case 1:
Similar to Case 0, we can use modular arithmetic to find the solution. The only difference is that the remainder will be multiplied by 3 instead of 2.

Case 2:
In this case, we can use a similar approach as in Case 0 and Case 1. However, the remainder will be multiplied by 3 instead of 2.

Case 3:
Here, we can use the same approach as in Case 0, Case 1, and Case 2. The only difference is that the remainder will be multiplied by 3 instead of 2.

Test Case:
For the test case, we can follow the same approach as in the previous cases. The only difference is that the remainder will be multiplied by 3 instead of 2.

In summary, the solutions for each case are as follows:

Case 0: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3]]
Case 1: [[3, 0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3]]
Case 2: [[0, 3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3], [3, 0, 3, 0]]
Case 3: [[3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 0, 0]]
Test Case: [[3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 0, 0]]
