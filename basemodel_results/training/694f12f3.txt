Test Case:
Input:
[[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the descriptions of the three cases:

Case 0: The input matrix is a 10x10 grid filled with zeros, except for the first five rows and columns which are filled with 4s. The output matrix is the same, except that the diagonal elements in the first five rows and columns are changed to 1s.

Case 1: The input matrix is the same as in Case 0, but with all the 4s replaced by 2s. The output matrix is the same, except that the diagonal elements in the first five rows and columns are changed to 2s.

Test Case: The input matrix is a 10x10 grid filled with 4s, except for the last five rows and columns which are filled with zeros. The output matrix is the same, except that the diagonal elements in the last five rows and columns are changed to 1s.

Here are the detailed steps to solve these cases:

Case 0:
1. Initialize an empty 10x10 matrix called output.
2. For each element in the input matrix, if it's in the first five rows and columns (i <= 4 and j <= 4), replace the value with 1, otherwise keep the value unchanged.
3. Assign the output matrix to the result.

Case 1:
1. Initialize an empty 10x10 matrix called output.
2. For each element in the input matrix, if it's in the first five rows and columns (i <= 4 and j <= 4), replace the value with 2, otherwise keep the value unchanged.
3. Assign the output matrix to the result.

Test Case:
1. Initialize an empty 10x10 matrix called output.
2. For each element in the input matrix, if it's in the last five rows and columns (i >= 5 and j >= 5), replace the value with 1, otherwise keep the value unchanged.
3. Assign the output matrix to the result.

Here are the detailed steps to solve the test case:

1. Initialize an empty 10x10 matrix called output.
2. For each element in the input matrix, if it's in the last five rows and columns (i >= 5 and j >= 5), replace the value with 1, otherwise keep the value unchanged.
3. Assign the output matrix to the result.
