Explanation: 
In this case, we have a 3x3 matrix where each row is a list of integers. The goal is to rearrange the columns such that the smallest element in each row is in the first column, the second smallest element in each row is in the second column, and the third smallest element in each row is in the third column. 

For the first case, we can see that the smallest element in each row is 1, the second smallest element is 2, and the third smallest element is 5. Therefore, the output is [[2, 1, 5], [2, 5, 2], [1, 1, 2]]. 

For the second case, the smallest element in each row is 2, the second smallest element is 5, and the third smallest element is 6. Therefore, the output is [[2, 6, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 2, 5]]. 

For the third case, the smallest element in each row is 2, the second smallest element is 6, and the third smallest element is 6. Therefore, the output is [[2, 2, 2], [6, 1, 6], [6, 1, 2]]. 

For the fourth case, the smallest element in each row is 9, the second smallest element is 3, and the third smallest element is 4. Therefore, the output is [[9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4]]. 

For the test case, the smallest element in each row is 9, the second smallest element is 3, and the third smallest element is 4. Therefore, the output is [[9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4]].
