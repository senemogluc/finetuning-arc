Test Case:
Input:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[2, 2], [2, 3]]

Explanation: 
In each of the given cases, the input is a 2D array of integers, and the output is a 2D array of integers. The elements in the output array represent the maximum values of the corresponding elements in the input array. 

For example, in the first case, the input array has 7 rows and 7 columns. The maximum value in each row is found by comparing the elements in that row. The resulting output array has 3 rows and 3 columns, where each element represents the maximum value in the corresponding row of the input array. 

Similarly, in the second case, the input array has 7 rows and 7 columns. The maximum value in each row is found by comparing the elements in that row. The resulting output array has 3 rows and 3 columns, where each element represents the maximum value in the corresponding row of the input array. 

In the third case, the input array has 7 rows and 7 columns. The maximum value in each row is found by comparing the elements in that row. The resulting output array has 3 rows and 3 columns, where each element represents the maximum value in the corresponding row of the input array. 

The test case follows the same pattern as the previous cases, where the input array has 7 rows and 7 columns. The maximum value in each row is found by comparing the elements in that row. The resulting output array has 3 rows and 3 columns, where each element represents the maximum value in the corresponding row of the input array.
