Explanation: 
In the given input, we have a 2D matrix. We need to find the rows in the matrix where the sum of the first two elements is non-zero and the corresponding column in the output matrix should have the maximum value from the third element of that row. 

For the first case, the sum of the first two elements in the first, third, and sixth rows are non-zero. The maximum value from the third element in these rows are 8, 9, and 5 respectively. So, the output matrix will be [[3, 0, 8], [0, 7, 0], [6, 0, 9]].

For the second case, the sum of the first two elements in the second, fifth, and eighth rows are non-zero. The maximum value from the third element in these rows are 2, 7, and 9 respectively. So, the output matrix will be [[0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0]].

For the third case, the sum of the first two elements in the first, third, and fourth rows are non-zero. The maximum value from the third element in these rows are 4, 5, and 5 respectively. So, the output matrix will be [[4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0]].
