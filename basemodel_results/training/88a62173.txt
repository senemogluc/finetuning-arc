GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[0, 2, 0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]]

Output:
[[2, 2], [2, 0]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]]

Output:
[[1, 0], [1, 1]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[8, 8, 0, 0, 8], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 8], [8, 0]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[5, 5, 0, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0, 0, 5]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[5, 5], [5, 5]]

Explanation: 
In each of the cases, we are given a 5x5 matrix where the rows represent the number of zeros and ones in each row of a binary matrix. The binary matrix is formed by taking the rows of the given matrix and concatenating them horizontally. 

For example, in the first case, the binary matrix is formed as follows:

00110
11001
00000
00000
11000

To find the output, we need to count the number of ones in each row and form a new matrix with the row counts. In the first case, the row counts are 2, 2, 0, 2, and 2, which can be represented as the matrix [[2, 2], [2, 0]].

Similarly, for the second and third cases, we can count the number of ones in each row to get the output matrices [[1, 0], [1, 1]] and [[0, 8], [8, 0]], respectively.

For the test case, we can count the number of ones in each row to get the output matrix [[5, 5], [5, 5]].
