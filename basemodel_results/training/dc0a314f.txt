Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[5, 5, 5, 2], [5, 2, 2, 5], [2, 2, 5, 5], [5, 5, 8, 5], [2, 5, 5, 4], [5, 5, 2, 2], [5, 2, 2, 5], [5, 2, 5, 5], [5, 2, 5, 5], [5, 2, 2, 5], [5, 5, 2, 2], [2, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 8, 5], [2, 2, 5, 8], [5, 2, 2, 5], [5, 5, 2, 5]]

Explanation: 
In each case, the input is a list of lists representing a matrix. The goal is to find the common patterns among the matrices. 

For example, in case 0, the common pattern among the matrices is that the first element in each matrix is 2. Therefore, the output is a list of lists where the first element is 2. 

Similarly, in case 1, the common pattern among the matrices is that the third element in each matrix is 7. Therefore, the output is a list of lists where the third element is 7. 

The process is repeated for each case, and the resulting lists are concatenated to form the final output.
