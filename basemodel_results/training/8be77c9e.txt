GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
The input is a 3x3 matrix with some zeros in it. The output is obtained by taking the input matrix and appending a row of zeros at the end, and then repeating the entire matrix twice. This is done to create a pattern where each element in the matrix is repeated 6 times.

Case 1:
The input is a 3x3 matrix with some zeros and ones in it. The output is obtained by taking the input matrix and appending a row of zeros at the end, and then repeating the entire matrix twice. This is done to create a pattern where each element in the matrix is repeated 6 times.

Case 2:
The input is a 3x3 matrix with all zeros in it. The output is obtained by taking the input matrix and appending a row of zeros at the end, and then repeating the entire matrix twice. This is done to create a pattern where each element in the matrix is repeated 6 times.

Test Case:
The input is a 3x3 matrix with some zeros in it. The output is obtained by taking the input matrix and appending a row of zeros at the end, and then repeating the entire matrix twice. This is done to create a pattern where each element in the matrix is repeated 6 times.

In all cases, the output is a 9x9 matrix where each element in the original matrix is repeated 6 times, and a row of zeros is appended at the end of the matrix.
