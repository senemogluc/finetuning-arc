Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1]]

Explanation:
In each case, the input is a 2D matrix with specific values. The output is the modified matrix after applying certain conditions. 

In Case 0, the input matrix has 0s and 8s in specific positions. The output matrix replaces the 8s with 1s and the 0s with 0s, resulting in a matrix with 1s and 0s in the same positions as the original 8s and 0s. 

In Case 1, the input matrix has 3s and 0s in specific positions. The output matrix replaces the 3s with 7s and the 0s with 0s, resulting in a matrix with 7s and 0s in the same positions as the original 3s and 0s. 

In Case 2, the input matrix has 0s and specific values in specific positions. The output matrix replaces the 0s with 0s and the specific values with 2s, resulting in a matrix with 2s and 0s in the same positions as the original 0s and specific values.

In the Test Case, the input matrix has 0s, 7s, and 6s in specific positions. The output matrix replaces the 7s with 1s and the 6s with 0s, resulting in a matrix with 1s and 0s in the same positions as the original 7s and 6s.
