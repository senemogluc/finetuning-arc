Explanation: 
In each of the given cases, the input is a 3x3 matrix where the elements are either 0 or 2. The output is a single-element list representing the sum of the elements in the matrix. 

For example, in Case 0, the sum of all elements in the matrix is 1 (2+0+2+0+2+0+2), so the output is [[1]]. Similarly, in Case 1, the sum of all elements is 7 (2+0+0+2+0+0+0), so the output is [[7]]. 

In the test case, the sum of all elements is 7 (2+0+2+2+2+0+2), so the output is [[7]].

In all cases, the output is a single-element list containing the sum of all elements in the matrix.
