Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[0, 0, 4], [0, 8, 6], [5, 6, 3]]

Explanation: 
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of matrix transpose. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows and columns. In this case, we need to transpose the input matrix and then add the corresponding elements of the resulting matrix to the input matrix.

For the first case, the transpose of the input matrix is:
[[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]

And the resulting matrix after adding the corresponding elements is:
[[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]

For the second case, the transpose of the input matrix is:
[[5, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

And the resulting matrix after adding the corresponding elements is:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]]

For the third case, the transpose of the input matrix is:
[[6, 6, 4], [3, 8, 0], [5, 0, 0]]

And the resulting matrix after adding the corresponding elements is:
[[0, 0, 4], [0, 8, 6], [5, 6, 3]]

Therefore, the answer is [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]] for the first case, [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]] for the second case, and [[0, 0, 4], [0, 8, 6], [5, 6, 3]] for the third case.
