GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]

Case 3:
Input:
[[0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the details for each case:

Case 0: 
Input: [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
To get the output, we need to find the minimum value in each row and replace all other values in that row with 0. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 1, so all other values in the first row are replaced with 0. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 0, so all values in the second row are already 0. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 0, so all values in the third row are already 0. 

Output: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]

Case 1: 
Input: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
Similar to the previous case, we find the minimum value in each row and replace all other values in that row with 0. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 0, so all values in the first row are already 0. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 1, so all other values in the second row are replaced with 0. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 0, so all values in the third row are already 0. 

Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]

Case 2: 
Input: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
Again, we find the minimum value in each row and replace all other values in that row with 0. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 0, so all values in the first row are already 0. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 1, so all other values in the second row are replaced with 0. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 0, so all values in the third row are already 0. 

Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]

Case 3: 
Input: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0]]
Here, we find the minimum value in each row and replace all other values in that row with 0. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 2, so all other values in the first row are replaced with 0. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 0, so all values in the second row are already 0. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 0, so all values in the third row are already 0. 

Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0]]

Test Case: 
Input: [[2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
For this test case, we find the minimum value in each row and replace all other values in that row with 0. 

For the first row, the minimum value is 2, so all other values in the first row are replaced with 0. 
For the second row, the minimum value is 2, so all other values in the second row are replaced with 0. 
For the third row, the minimum value is 0, so all values in the third row are already 0. 

Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
