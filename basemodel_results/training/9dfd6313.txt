GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[5, 0, 0], [3, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]

Output:
[[5, 3, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0], [6, 0, 5, 0], [6, 0, 4, 5]]

Output:
[[5, 0, 6, 6], [0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 4], [0, 0, 0, 5]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 5, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 5, 0], [0, 2, 0, 1, 5]]

Output:
[[5, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 5, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0], [2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an empty matrix of the same size as the input matrix, with all elements set to 0.
2. For each row in the input matrix, find the maximum element in that row.
3. Replace the row in the output matrix with the row from the input matrix, but replace the maximum element with 0.
4. Replace the maximum element in the output matrix with the maximum element found in step 2.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each row in the input matrix.
6. Return the output matrix.

Now, let's apply these steps to the test case:

Input: [[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0], [2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]

Step 1: Initialize an empty matrix of the same size as the input matrix, with all elements set to 0. The output matrix will be a 6x6 matrix with all elements set to 0.

Step 2-4: For each row in the input matrix:
- For the first row, the maximum element is 5. Replace the first row in the output matrix with the first row from the input matrix, but replace the 5 with 0. Replace the maximum element in the output matrix with 5. The first row of the output matrix is now [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
- For the second row, the maximum element is 5. Replace the second row in the output matrix with the second row from the input matrix, but replace the 5 with 0. Replace the maximum element in the output matrix with 5. The second row of the output matrix is now [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0].
- For the third row, the maximum element is 5. Replace the third row in the output matrix with the third row from the input matrix, but replace the 5 with 0. Replace the maximum element in the output matrix with 5. The third row of the output matrix is now [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0].
- For the fourth row, the maximum element is 5. Replace the fourth row in the output matrix with the fourth row from the input matrix, but replace the 5 with 0. Replace the maximum element in the output matrix with 5. The fourth row of the output matrix is now [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0].
- For the fifth row, the maximum element is 8. Replace the fifth row in the output matrix with the fifth row from the input matrix, but replace the 8 with 0. Replace the maximum element in the output matrix with 8. The fifth row of the output matrix is now [2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0].
- For the sixth row, the maximum element is 6. Replace the sixth row in the output matrix with the sixth row from the input matrix, but replace the 6 with 0. Replace the maximum element in the output matrix with 6. The sixth row of the output matrix is now [2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5].

Step 5: Return the output matrix.

Output: [[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]
