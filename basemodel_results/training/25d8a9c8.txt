Explanation: 
In this problem, we are given a 3x3 matrix where each element is a non-negative integer. We need to find the output matrix where each element in the output matrix is the minimum of the corresponding element in the input matrix and the element's position in the output matrix. 

For example, in the first test case, the input matrix is:
[[4, 4, 4], [2, 3, 2], [2, 3, 3]]

The output matrix is calculated as follows:
- The first row of the output matrix is [5, 5, 5], because 5 is the minimum of 4, 4, and 4.
- The second row of the output matrix is [0, 0, 0], because 0 is the minimum of 2, 3, and 2.
- The third row of the output matrix is also [0, 0, 0], because 0 is the minimum of 2, 3, and 3.

Following this logic, we can calculate the output matrix for the given test case as [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5]].
