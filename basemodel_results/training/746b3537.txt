GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1]]

Output:
[[1], [2], [1]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]

Output:
[[3, 4, 6]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1]]

Output:
[[2, 3, 8, 1]]

Case 3:
Input:
[[2, 2], [6, 6], [8, 8], [8, 8]]

Output:
[[2], [6], [8]]

Case 4:
Input:
[[4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3]]

Output:
[[4], [2], [8], [3]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4], [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4], [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4], [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]]

Explanation: 
In this case, all the input lists are the same, except for the first element of the first list, which is 1 instead of 2. Therefore, the output is the same as the input, with the first element of each list being 1 instead of 2.

The correct output for the test case is:

[[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]]
