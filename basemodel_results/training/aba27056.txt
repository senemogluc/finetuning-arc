Explanation:
The given input is a 2D array of integers. The output is obtained by adding 4 to each element in the array, except for the last row and column, which remain unchanged. 

In the first case, the input is a 3x3 array with all elements equal to 0. After adding 4 to each element, the output is a 3x3 array with all elements equal to 4. 

In the second case, the input is a 5x3 array with all elements equal to 3, except for the last row and column, which are all zeros. After adding 4 to each element, the output is a 5x3 array with all elements equal to 4, except for the last row and column, which are all zeros. 

In the third case, the input is a 7x3 array with all elements equal to 3, except for the last row and column, which are all zeros. After adding 4 to each element, the output is a 7x3 array with all elements equal to 4, except for the last row and column, which are all zeros. 

In the fourth case, the input is a 3x9 array with all elements equal to 0, except for the last row and column, which are all zeros. After adding 4 to each element, the output is a 3x9 array with all elements equal to 4, except for the last row and column, which are all zeros.
