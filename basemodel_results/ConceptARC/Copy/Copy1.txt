GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[2, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2]]

Output:
[[2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4], [4, 4, 4]]

Output:
[[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an empty matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix.
2. Iterate through each row of the input matrix.
3. For each row, find the maximum value and its index.
4. Replace the maximum value in the row with 0 and add the maximum value to the corresponding position in the output matrix.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each row of the input matrix.
6. The output matrix will contain all the maximum values from the input matrix.

Applying these steps to the test case:

Input: [[8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8]]

1. Initialize an empty matrix with dimensions 5x3.
2. Iterate through each row of the input matrix:
   - For the first row, the maximum value is 8 and its index is 0. Replace 8 with 0 and add 8 to the corresponding position in the output matrix: [[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0]]
   - For the second row, the maximum value is 0 and its index is 1. Replace 0 with 0 and add 0 to the corresponding position in the output matrix: [[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0]]
   - For the third row, the maximum value is 8 and its index is 2. Replace 8 with 0 and add 8 to the corresponding position in the output matrix: [[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0]]
   - For the fourth row, the maximum value is 0 and its index is 3. Replace 0 with 0 and add 0 to the corresponding position in the output matrix: [[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0]]
   - For the fifth row, the maximum value is 8 and its index is 4. Replace 8 with 0 and add 8 to the corresponding position in the output matrix: [[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0]]
3. The output matrix is [[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0]].

Therefore, the answer is [[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0]].
