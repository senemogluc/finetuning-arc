GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4], [2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4], [2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4]]

Output:
[[2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4], [2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4], [2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4], [2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4], [2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9]]

Output:
[[6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [6, 4, 4, 6, 0, 1, 3, 3, 1], [6, 4, 4, 6, 0, 1, 3, 3, 1], [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
The input consists of three 2D arrays, each with the same number of rows and columns. In this case, we can simply concatenate the arrays horizontally to create a larger array. The resulting array will have the same number of rows as the original arrays, but with the columns from each original array arranged side by side. The resulting array will have an additional row of zeros at the end, as specified in the problem statement.

Case 1:
In this case, the input consists of three 2D arrays with the same number of rows and columns. Similar to Case 0, we can concatenate the arrays horizontally. However, in this case, we also need to insert an additional row of zeros after every original array. This results in a larger array with an extra row of zeros between each original array.

Test Case:
For the test case, we follow the same process as in Case 0 and Case 1. We concatenate the 2D arrays horizontally and insert an additional row of zeros after each original array. The resulting array will have the same number of rows as the original arrays, with the columns from each original array arranged side by side, and an extra row of zeros between each original array.

In all cases, the output will be a larger 2D array with the specified structure, where each row contains the same number of elements as the original arrays, and an additional row of zeros at the end of the array (Case 0) or after each original array (Case 1 and Test Case).
