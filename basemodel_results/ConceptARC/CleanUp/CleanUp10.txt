GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
In this case, we can observe that all the elements in the input matrix are either 0 or 2. The output matrix is obtained by subtracting 2 from each element of the input matrix. This is because, when we subtract 2 from an element that is already 0, we get 0, and when we subtract 2 from an element that is 2, we get 0. Therefore, the output matrix is formed by subtracting 2 from each element of the input matrix.

Case 1:
In this case, we can observe that all the elements in the input matrix are either 0 or 2. Similar to Case 0, the output matrix is obtained by subtracting 2 from each element of the input matrix. This is because, when we subtract 2 from an element that is already 0, we get 0, and when we subtract 2 from an element that is 2, we get 0. Therefore, the output matrix is formed by subtracting 2 from each element of the input matrix.

Test Case:
In this case, we can also observe that all the elements in the input matrix are either 0 or 2. Similar to the previous cases, the output matrix is obtained by subtracting 2 from each element of the input matrix. This is because, when we subtract 2 from an element that is already 0, we get 0, and when we subtract 2 from an element that is 2, we get 0. Therefore, the output matrix is formed by subtracting 2 from each element of the input matrix.
