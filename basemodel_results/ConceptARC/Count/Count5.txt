Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
In this case, the input matrix is a 7x7 matrix with all zeros except for the middle 3x3 submatrix, which is filled with 3's. The output is a 1x1 matrix with a single zero. This is because the 3x3 submatrix is not connected to the rest of the matrix, and the algorithm treats it as a separate entity. Therefore, the algorithm only considers the 3x3 submatrix, which contains only zeros.

Case 1:
In this case, the input matrix is a 7x7 matrix with all zeros except for the middle 3x3 submatrix, which is filled with 3's. The output is a 1x4 matrix with all zeros. This is because the algorithm treats the 3x3 submatrix as a separate entity, and the rest of the matrix is filled with zeros.

Case 2:
In this case, the input matrix is a 7x7 matrix with all zeros except for the middle 3x3 submatrix, which is filled with 3's. The output is a 1x6 matrix with all zeros. This is because the algorithm treats the 3x3 submatrix as a separate entity, and the rest of the matrix is filled with zeros.

Test Case:
In this case, the input matrix is a 7x7 matrix with all zeros except for the middle 3x3 submatrix, which is filled with 3's. The output is a 1x7 matrix with all zeros. This is because the algorithm treats the 3x3 submatrix as a separate entity, and the rest of the matrix is filled with zeros.

In summary, the algorithm treats the 3x3 submatrix as a separate entity and fills the output matrix with zeros, depending on the size of the rest of the matrix.
