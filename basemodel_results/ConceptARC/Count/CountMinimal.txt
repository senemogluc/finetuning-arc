Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
The input matrix is a 6x6 matrix with all elements as 0 except for the element at position (1,2) and (3,2) which are 2. The output matrix is a 1x1 matrix with all elements as 0. This is because there are no adjacent elements with a value of 2 in the input matrix.

Case 1:
The input matrix is a 6x6 matrix with all elements as 0 except for the elements at positions (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and (5,2) which are 2. The output matrix is a 2x1 matrix with all elements as 0. This is because there are two adjacent elements with a value of 2 in the input matrix, one at position (1,2) and the other at position (2,2). However, the element at position (1,2) is not adjacent to any other element with a value of 2 in the input matrix.

Case 2:
The input matrix is a 6x6 matrix with all elements as 0 except for the elements at positions (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), and (5,2) which are 2. The output matrix is a 0x0 matrix, meaning an empty matrix. This is because there are four adjacent elements with a value of 2 in the input matrix, and each of these elements is adjacent to at least one other element with a value of 2 in the input matrix.

Test Case:
The input matrix is a 6x6 matrix with all elements as 0 except for the elements at positions (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), and (4,2) which are 2. The output matrix is a 1x2 matrix with all elements as 0. This is because there are two adjacent elements with a value of 2 in the input matrix, one at position (1,2) and the other at position (2,2). However, the element at position (1,2) is not adjacent to any other element with a value of 2 in the input matrix.
