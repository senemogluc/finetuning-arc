Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
The input matrix is a 9x9 matrix with 0s and 3s arranged in a specific pattern. The pattern is as follows:

1. The first row and the last row have all 0s.
2. The second row, fourth row, and seventh row have all 3s.
3. The third row, fifth row, and eighth row have a pattern of 3s and 0s alternating.
4. The ninth row has all 0s.

The output is obtained by taking the sum of each column in the matrix. Since the sum of the 0s is 0, the output is a matrix with a single column of all 0s.

Case 1:
The input matrix is a 9x9 matrix with a pattern of 0s and 2s. The pattern is as follows:

1. The first row, second row, fourth row, and seventh row have all 0s.
2. The third row, fifth row, and eighth row have all 2s.
3. The sixth row has a pattern of 2s and 0s alternating.

The output is obtained by taking the sum of each column in the matrix. Since the sum of the 0s is 0, the output is a matrix with a single column of all 0s.

Case 2:
The input matrix is a 12x9 matrix with a pattern of 0s and 4s. The pattern is as follows:

1. The first row, second row, fourth row, and seventh row have all 0s.
2. The third row, fifth row, and eighth row have all 4s.
3. The ninth row, eleventh row, and twelfth row have a pattern of 4s and 0s alternating.
4. The tenth row has a pattern of 4s and 0s alternating, but with a single 0 at the end.

The output is obtained by taking the sum of each column in the matrix. Since the sum of the 0s is 0, the output is a matrix with a single column of all 0s.

Test Case:
The input matrix is a 12x9 matrix with a pattern of 0s, 6s, and alternating patterns. The pattern is as follows:

1. The first row, second row, fourth row, and seventh row have all 0s.
2. The third row, fifth row, and eighth row have all 6s.
3. The ninth row, eleventh row, and twelfth row have a pattern of 6s and 0s alternating.
4. The tenth row has a pattern of 6s and 0s alternating, but with a single 0 at the end.

The output is obtained by taking the sum of each column in the matrix. Since the sum of the 0s is 0, the output is a matrix with a single column of all 0s.
