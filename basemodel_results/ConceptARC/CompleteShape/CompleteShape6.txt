GPT4 Correct User: Case 0:
Input:
[[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
The input matrix is a 6x6 matrix. Each row in the matrix is a state of a 6-cell maze, where 0 represents an empty cell and 1 represents a wall. The output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as there are no changes needed.

Case 1:
The input matrix has a different structure compared to Case 0. Each row in the matrix is a state of a 6-cell maze, but with two different types of walls represented by 0 and 4. The output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as there are no changes needed.

Test Case:
The input matrix has a similar structure to Case 1, but with different values for the walls. The output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as there are no changes needed. 

In all three cases, the input and output matrices are the same, as there are no changes needed in the maze states.
