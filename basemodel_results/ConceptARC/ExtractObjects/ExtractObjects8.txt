Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]

Explanation:
In each of the test cases, the input is a list of lists containing integers. The goal is to find a pattern or rule that can be applied to the input to generate the corresponding output. 

For Case 0, the input consists of a repeating pattern of 3's followed by a 0. The output is a list containing the first two occurrences of this pattern, i.e., [3, 3] and [3, 3]. 

For Case 1, the input also follows a pattern of 4's followed by a 0, but with some variations. The output is a list of the positions where the 0's appear, along with the surrounding 4's. 

For Test Case, the input consists of a repeating pattern of 6's followed by a 0. The output is a list of the positions where the 0's appear, along with the surrounding 6's.

In all cases, the pattern is identified, and the positions of the 0's (or any other specified value) along with the surrounding values are returned as the output.
