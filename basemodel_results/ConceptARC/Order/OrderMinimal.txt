Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: Here are the detailed explanations for each case:

Case 0:
In this case, we have a 6x6 matrix with all zeros except for the lower right corner, where the values increase from left to right and bottom to top. The output is obtained by shifting the values one position to the left and one position up. This is done to maintain the pattern of increasing values.

Case 1:
Similar to Case 0, we have a 6x6 matrix with all zeros except for the lower right corner, where the values increase from left to right and bottom to top. The output is obtained by shifting the values one position to the left and one position up. This is done to maintain the pattern of increasing values.

Case 2:
In this case, we have a 6x6 matrix with all zeros except for the lower right corner, where the values increase from left to right and bottom to top. However, the values in the fourth row are non-zero. The output is obtained by shifting the values one position to the left and one position up, while also replacing the non-zero values in the fourth row with zeros. This is done to maintain the pattern of increasing values.

Test Case:
In this case, we have a 6x6 matrix with all zeros except for the lower right corner, where the values increase from left to right and bottom to top. The output is obtained by shifting the values one position to the left and one position up. This is done to maintain the pattern of increasing values.

In all cases, the output is obtained by shifting the values one position to the left and one position up, while also ensuring that the pattern of increasing values is maintained.
