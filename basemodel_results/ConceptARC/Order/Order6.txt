Explanation:
In this test case, the input is a 2D array of integers. The goal is to modify the array so that all elements in the array are 0, except for the first element in each row, which should be the corresponding value from the original array. 

To achieve this, we iterate through each row in the array and set all elements in the row to 0, except for the first element, which is set to the original value. 

For example, in the first row of the original array, the value 0 is set to 0, and the value 4 is set to 4. In the second row, the value 4 is set to 0, and the value 0 is set to 0. This process is repeated for all rows in the array, resulting in the modified array as shown in the output.

The modified array is returned as the result.
