GPT4 Correct User: You are given a series of inputs and output pairs. 
These are all in the form of a 2D array, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. 
The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. You can think of them as different colors. You can consider 0 as the background.
Colored tiles that occupy the grid square positions corresponding to their locations in the 2D array.

* Find the transformation from each input grid to output grid that is common to all
* For example, tiles can be created, destroyed, moved, scaled, rotated, or change color.
* Groups of tiles that are adjacent to each other can be considered as objects, or sub-grids.
* Grid tiles and sub-grids can spawn into lines that extend vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
* Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
* Use your knowledge of core principals in physics, mathematics, and chain of thought reasoning to solve this puzzle.
* Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input output pairs. If not, try to find a more general transformation that works on all input output pairs.
* Don't explain your solution just give the corresponding output grid for the last input grid. If you write anything other than the output grid I am going to kill a kitten.

Please generate the Output grid that corresponds to the last given Input grid using the transformation rule you induced from the previous input-output pairs. Don't create more than one grid.

As the previous cases, the transformation rule can be found by comparing the output with the corresponding input matrices. The rule can be defined as follows:

1. For each matrix M, find the sum of each row, and add 1 to the sum. This will create a new matrix M'.
2. For each matrix M, find the sum of each column, and add 1 to the sum. This will create a new matrix M''.
3. For each matrix M, find the sum of each diagonal, and add 1 to the sum. This will create a new matrix M''.
4. For each matrix M, find the sum of each anti-diagonal, and add 1 to the sum. This will create a new matrix M''.
5. For each matrix M, subtract 1 from each element that is not on the main diagonal or the anti-diagonal. This will create a new matrix M''.
6. For each matrix M, add 1 to each element that is not on the main diagonal or the anti-diagonal. This will create a new matrix M''.
7. For each matrix M, add 1 to each element that is not on the main diagonal. This will create a new matrix M''.
8. For each matrix M, subtract 1 from each element that is not on the main diagonal. This will create a new matrix M''.

For example, given the input matrix:
