GPT4 Correct User: You are given a series of inputs and output pairs. 
These are all in the form of a 2D array, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. 
The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. You can think of them as different colors. You can consider 0 as the background.
Colored tiles that occupy the grid square positions corresponding to their locations in the 2D array.

* Find the transformation from each input grid to output grid that is common to all
* For example, tiles can be created, destroyed, moved, scaled, rotated, or change color.
* Groups of tiles that are adjacent to each other can be considered as objects, or sub-grids.
* Grid tiles and sub-grids can spawn into lines that extend vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
* Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
* Use your knowledge of core principals in physics, mathematics, and chain of thought reasoning to solve this puzzle.
* Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input output pairs. If not, try to find a more general transformation that works on all input output pairs.
* Don't explain your solution just give the corresponding output grid for the last input grid. If you write anything other than the output grid I am going to kill a kitten.

Please generate the Output grid that corresponds to the last given Input grid using the transformation rule you induced from the previous input-output pairs. Don't create more than one grid.

This is the transformation rule that we induced from the previous input-output pairs:

1. For each non-zero value in the input grid, count the number of its occurrences in the same row and column. If the count is odd, replace the value with 0; otherwise, replace it with the complement of the value modulo 9 (i.e., the value minus 9 if it's odd, or the value plus 9 if it's even).

2. For each zero value in the input grid, count the number of its occurrences in the same row and column. If the count is odd, replace the value with 9; otherwise, replace it with the complement of the value modulo 9 (i.e., the value minus 9 if it's odd, or the value plus 9 if it's even).
