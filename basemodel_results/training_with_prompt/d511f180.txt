GPT4 Correct User: You are given a series of inputs and output pairs. 
These are all in the form of a 2D array, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. 
The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. You can think of them as different colors. You can consider 0 as the background.
Colored tiles that occupy the grid square positions corresponding to their locations in the 2D array.

* Find the transformation from each input grid to output grid that is common to all
* For example, tiles can be created, destroyed, moved, scaled, rotated, or change color.
* Groups of tiles that are adjacent to each other can be considered as objects, or sub-grids.
* Grid tiles and sub-grids can spawn into lines that extend vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
* Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
* Use your knowledge of core principals in physics, mathematics, and chain of thought reasoning to solve this puzzle.
* Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input output pairs. If not, try to find a more general transformation that works on all input output pairs.
* Don't explain your solution just give the corresponding output grid for the last input grid. If you write anything other than the output grid I am going to kill a kitten.

Please generate the Output grid that corresponds to the last given Input grid using the transformation rule you induced from the previous input-output pairs. Don't create more than one grid.

Case 0:
Input:
[[2, 7, 8, 8, 8], [5, 5, 6, 5, 4], [8, 5, 5, 5, 2], [8, 8, 4, 3, 6], [6, 5, 1, 9, 3]]

Output:
[[2, 7, 5, 5, 5], [8, 8, 6, 8, 4], [5, 8, 8, 8, 2], [5, 5, 4, 3, 6], [6, 8, 1, 9, 3]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[3, 5, 1], [4, 5, 8], [2, 4, 9]]

Output:
[[3, 8, 1], [4, 8, 5], [2, 4, 9]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[6, 5, 3], [5, 7, 5], [8, 8, 2]]

Output:
[[6, 8, 3], [8, 7, 8], [5, 5, 2]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[8, 8, 4, 5], [3, 8, 7, 5], [3, 7, 1, 9], [6, 4, 8, 8]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[8, 8, 4, 5], [3, 8, 7, 5], [3, 7, 1, 9], [6, 4, 8, 8]]
