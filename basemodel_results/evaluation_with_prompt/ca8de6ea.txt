GPT4 Correct User: You are given a series of inputs and output pairs. 
These are all in the form of a 2D array, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. 
The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. You can think of them as different colors. You can consider 0 as the background.
Colored tiles that occupy the grid square positions corresponding to their locations in the 2D array.

* Find the transformation from each input grid to output grid that is common to all
* For example, tiles can be created, destroyed, moved, scaled, rotated, or change color.
* Groups of tiles that are adjacent to each other can be considered as objects, or sub-grids.
* Grid tiles and sub-grids can spawn into lines that extend vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
* Apply counting and basic arithmetic for tasks involving numerical aspects.
* Use your knowledge of core principals in physics, mathematics, and chain of thought reasoning to solve this puzzle.
* Check whether your transformation also works on the previous input output pairs. If not, try to find a more general transformation that works on all input output pairs.
* Don't explain your solution just give the corresponding output grid for the last input grid. If you write anything other than the output grid I am going to kill a kitten.

Please generate the Output grid that corresponds to the last given Input grid using the transformation rule you induced from the previous input-output pairs. Don't create more than one grid.Case 0:
Input:
[[1, 0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 5, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 5, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 1]]

Output:
[[1, 5, 9], [8, 7, 8], [9, 5, 1]]

Case 1:
Input:
[[6, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 2, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 6]]

Output:
[[6, 2, 7], [4, 3, 4], [7, 2, 6]]

Case 2:
Input:
[[2, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 3, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]]

Output:
[[2, 3, 1], [6, 4, 6], [1, 3, 2]]

Test Case:
Input:
[[7, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 6, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 6, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 7]]

Output: GPT4 Correct Assistant: [[7, 6, 5], [4, 2, 4], [5, 2, 7]]
